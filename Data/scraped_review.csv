Toy Story,John Lasseter has delivered a great adventure story that will not only entertain children but can also be enjoyed as a jokey parable by adults.,1
Toy Story,"Children must eventually outgrow their toys and it’s this existential fear that informs the animated film. Even as its characters worry about getting left behind, the movie is a perfectly preserved snapshot of childhood, a time gone by.",1
Toy Story,"Despite the animation not holding up, Toy Story is a flawless movie. The writing and characters are amazing.",1
Toy Story,"You don't have to be a kid to enjoy it, just have a sense of humor.",1
Toy Story,"... a tight, inventive script that balances strongly etched characters with a tremendous sense of play, and brings it to life with vividly realized characters.",1
Toy Story,"Whenever watching the film, an eternally charming account of the world of toys, imagine that the story told is that of Pixar, the little company who proved, both through their own story and their film, the infinite possibility of imagination.",1
Toy Story,I always look back to Toy Story as the match that lit my movie-loving fuse.,1
Toy Story,"We have seen the future of cartoons, and its name is Toy Story.",1
Toy Story,"An unforgettable, groundbreaking, absolutely winning masterpiece.",1
Toy Story,"Toy Story takes a number of surprising turns, and though I didn't fall in love with it -- there's a lot of routine clobbering, scrambling, and zooming about -- I remained interested and happy until the end (and children, I think, will adore it).",1
GoldenEye,"This new era of Brosnan films became a little campy as time went on, but Goldeneye stands out among the rest.",2
GoldenEye,GoldenEye remains the best Pierce Brosnan film of the James Bond franchise.,2
GoldenEye,GoldenEye tried to breathe new life into the franchise and it succeeded!,2
GoldenEye,"Directed by Martin Campbell, a newcomer to the genre, Goldeneye has as many special effects as any Bond film, and, for the most part, it delivers. It should be the real test as to whether a Bond audience still exists.",2
GoldenEye,"The best bit of casting is Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp, who equates sex and death more than any other Bond character.",2
GoldenEye,"...sets the stage for the rough-edged, real-world 007 we would eventually get.",2
GoldenEye,"GoldenEye was a massive return to form, modernizing Bond for a new era of filmgoers and introducing Pierce Brosnan to the role.",2
GoldenEye,"In trying so hard to distance itself from old Bonds, Goldeneye is also now a relic of the post-Cold War era.",2
GoldenEye,The tank chase through St. Petersburg is perhaps the greatest action scene in any Bond film to date.,2
GoldenEye,Goldeneye never loses sight what this film is about. The spy game is all about secrets and betrayal and if you are a spy - keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Goldeneye epitomizes that phrase.,2
Four Rooms,"No one at all seems to have directed Tim Roth who, as the bellhop linking the segments, tries to do a Jerry Lewis and ends up with a twitching, mugging, achingly unfunny performance that he will come to regard as an embarrassment.",3
Four Rooms,"It's questionable which got the worst of the bargain. In any case, this is one of the more interesting disasters of the waning film year.",3
Four Rooms,The weakest entries are absolutely dreadful.,3
Four Rooms,"On the one hand, TIm Roth gives the bellhop an almost Charlie Chaplin silent film feel. The impish looks, the exaggerated shock takes, the way he bounces in place or struts behind his room service cart. On the other hand, he has lines.",3
Four Rooms,"Begins with two awful segments, which you'll want to fast-forward past to get to the third and fourth segments.",3
Four Rooms,"A ghastly train wreck of a movie, littered with the corpses of promising careers.",3
Four Rooms,"The results are mainly awful, and even Roth got saddled with a mannered part that he can't comfortably play.",3
Four Rooms,"Four of the hottest indie directors--Anders, Rockwell, Tarantino, and Rodrigues--miss a unique opportunity to display their idiosyncratic talents resulting in a tedious anthology in which 2 segments are inept, one barely decent, and one OK (guess whose)",3
Four Rooms,"O episdio dirigido por Taratino, que funciona como uma grande preparao para uma excelente tirada final, memorvel. Pena que temos que assistir a uma hora de besteiras para chegar at ele.",3
Four Rooms,They should have called this One Room and released it as a Rodriguez short.,3
Get Shorty,DeVito's wicked version of a self-absorbed superstar is worth the price of admission alone.,4
Get Shorty,"The screenplay is brilliant (based on the novel by Elmore Leonard), interweaving fast-paced dialogue with sharp editing and plenty of humor.",4
Get Shorty,"How cool can a mere movie be? A perfect cast and great script, based on a hilariously witty best seller, are key elements. When you add a talented director and let the magic of Hollywood take over, the result is Get Shorty.",4
Get Shorty,"Like the Elmore Leonard novel it adapts, Get Shorty is fast, very funny, minorly caustic, and about as consequential and lasting as the movies Chili himself tries to green-light.",4
Get Shorty,Get Shorty - for all its critical and commercial acclaim - has never received its due as one of the funniest Hollywood films of modern times.,4
Get Shorty,Get Shorty belongs to a long line of spoofs that still appeal to Hollywood magic in their very design.,4
Get Shorty,It's terrifically entertaining.,4
Get Shorty,"A pleasing satire on gangsters, hustlers and Hollywood.",4
Get Shorty,A freewheeling comedy-thriller with the gift of the gab.,4
Get Shorty,"Hollywood has been in love with mobsters since the beginning of movies. But the other side of the equation has seldom been considered. That is, until now.",4
Copycat,"Copycat is a well-paced thriller, adroit, compelling, and slick.",5
Copycat,It's one of the better thrillers of the 1990s.,5
Copycat,What raises Copycat marginally above the second-rate and impotent is director Jon Amiel.,5
Copycat,"Although the plotting of this mystery-thriller about a copycat killer is flawed, Hunter and Weaver drive the show with strong performances.",5
Copycat,A straightforward intelligent thriller.,5
Copycat,A serial killer drama that stands above the rest of the copycats.,5
Copycat,Killer star power propels Copycat.,5
Copycat,"A grade B thriller with a grade A cast, and this time the cast makes all the difference.",5
Copycat,This is a movie with a roll-your-eyes- plot made respectable by an ace cast.,5
Copycat,"Inventive, stylish and gripping.",5
Shanghai Triad,"Though autobiography may not have been Zhang Yimou's intention with Shanghai Triad, it's hard not to see the film as a form of self-critique, not least because Boss may be ruthless, but he's also clever, charismatic, and perceptive...",6
Shanghai Triad,"In the end, Shanghai Triad isnt the most complex or nuanced film out of Zhangs varied filmography, but it still manages to be a layered examination of the triad world.",6
Shanghai Triad,A typically formidable performance by Gong Li .,6
Shanghai Triad,"On paper, a pretty tired old story of a gangster and a gangster's moll, but Zhang's telling of it is so meticulous, so layered, that it feels fresh at every turn.",6
Shanghai Triad,A film that would persuade you to support Mao's revolution if only for wiping out the feudal-like criminal gangs.,6
Shanghai Triad,"The film's told from the the boy's viewpoint and as a result, the narrative occasionally has a halting quality. The scenes of sudden violence, however, are orchestrated with visceral effect by Zhang...",6
Shanghai Triad,"Less a crime or action flick than a class drama, Shanghai Triad regretfully reminds us that even those who set themselves on a path out of nameless poverty are at the whim of the men with the real power.",6
Shanghai Triad,"A deep, powerful and rivetingly complex study of Tienanmen - and, ironically, it's far more evenhanded in its account of the massacre that killed more than a thousand protesters than the Chinese government might suspect.",6
Shanghai Triad,A powerful portrait of mob power from the gifted and versatile director Yimou.,6
Shanghai Triad,"Soando como um mero veículo para a beleza de Gong Li, este aspirante a Ajuste Final conta com uma bela fotografia (com exceção da noite americana pavorosa), mas nada mais, revelando-se o pior filme da carreira de Yimou.",6
Twelve Monkeys,The fine line between the reasonable and the absurd is at the center of this flawed but gripping story about apocalypses and time-travel.,7
Twelve Monkeys,"Their aesthetic production is taken at face value, their delusion is validated by the collective imagination...",7
Twelve Monkeys,"The movie contemplates the circularities of time, apocalypse culture, and movies themselves... That shouldn't seem like some kind of pop miracle, but it does.",7
Twelve Monkeys,"Soothing in its inevitability, Melancholia without the really heavy devastation...",7
Twelve Monkeys,"It is only the latest in a parade of movie downers intent on convincing us that the future will be a bleak world that is either devoid of water and gas, or one in which we've blown ourselves up with atomic power. Enough.",7
Twelve Monkeys,The great Terry Gilliam's dystopic (of course!) vision of a future where we can't tell what's real or not seems disturbingly prescient.,7
Twelve Monkeys,"The received wisdom is that science fiction is always, when you get right down to it, about the period in which it is written, but in the grim Spring of 2020... 12 Monkeys looks startlingly prescient, even if the dates are wide by a decade or two.",7
Twelve Monkeys,"...12 Monkeys looks back fondly to a cleaner air world, before the virus wars began and societal norms collapsed, and can't help but strike a chord now...",7
Twelve Monkeys,"The fact that we, the audience, begin to question whether or not Cole is a time traveler at all, whether the apocalyptic future he claims to be from is real within the scope of the film, speaks to the talented screenwriters, direction, and editing.",7
Twelve Monkeys,I didn't care largely because of the lack of authenticity that Willis brings to the character of James Cole.,7
Babe,"Babe is a delightful tale told with untold depths of joy and acceptance. It says that not only should you be accepted for who you are, you should be accepted regardless of what you choose to do or who you choose to be.",8
Babe,"Over 25 years later, Babe remains one of 1995's best pictures of the year.",8
Babe,"Much to my surprise, I found Babe charming in an eccentric, oddly tough-minded sort of way. And if it isn't quite good enough to change my mind about the entire critter-chat genre, it is certainly good enough to recommend.",8
Babe,"Wise, captivating and thoroughly loony, this artful little farm fable is one of those rare films that works for all age levels.",8
Babe,"He's brave and bright, good-natured and ambitious, naive and vulnerable. All in all, he's probably the most winsome orphan to appear on the screen since Freddie Bartholomew impersonated David Copperfield 60 years ago.",8
Babe,"Thanks to well-trained live animals, clever voice characterizations and a big dash of muppetry from Henson's Creature Shop, Babe and his barnyard friends not only walk the walk and trot the trot, they also talk the talk.",8
Babe,"Here's the summer's sleeper for kids and their parents, a terrific picture that takes a lot of risks and makes them all pay off in a charming story about a pig who fancies himself a sheepdog -- or sheep-pig.",8
Babe,"Babe is not, strictly speaking, a kid's movie. It is a preposterously funny fable that strikes a chord with adults, too.",8
Babe,The hero of the children's movie Babe is probably the summer's most likable character -- a pig so appealing he may have your family swearing off hot dogs.,8
Babe,"For children, the movie will play like a storybook come to life. Adults, at first, will marvel at the special effects and puppetry. But ultimately, they'll be won over by the nuances of a story that finds a fresh way to deliver a timeless message.",8
Dead Man Walking,"A riveting, thought-provoking drama.",9
Dead Man Walking,"Penn plays Matthew with a quiet, feral intensity...",9
Dead Man Walking,"Penn and Sarandon in their final moments together achieve a strange transcendence that makes the end of Dead Man Walking sobering and horrifying, yet oddly uplifting.",9
Dead Man Walking,"It's a strong film, made stronger by two terrific performances. Penn's acting has ruthless honesty.",9
Dead Man Walking,"Intense '90s death-penalty drama has cursing, violence.",9
Dead Man Walking,"It doesn't flinch from presenting the crime committed, and yet, it's a film that undoubtedly is against capital punishment.",9
Dead Man Walking,It's an important film and a beautifully made film too.,9
Dead Man Walking,"A powerful and provocative film -- not quite a work of art, maybe, but close enough to demand your respectful attention.",9
Dead Man Walking,"Has the distinction of including not one, but two of the greatest screen performances of all time...undeniably one of the most gut-churning emotional experiences of 1990s cinema... [Blu-ray]",9
Dead Man Walking,"To say that the movie is neither for nor against capital punishment is disingenuous. Still, this is a fine and painful effort overall.",9
Richard III,"Packed full of impressive names and receiving plenty of awards nods, this cleverly adapted Shakespeare classic makes a strong impact from start to finish.",10
Richard III,"An inspired Shakespeare update with a terrifying Ian McKellen performance at its center, this is a masterpiece of its own.",10
Richard III,"It is a brutal reminder that while we may be able to inoculate ourselves against diseases of the body, diseases of the mind will always flourish as long as fascist impulses remain undiagnosed.",10
Richard III,Olivier's classic Shakespeare adaptation has some violence.,10
Richard III,"But when thoughts turn to the Bard, and his unique way of pinpointing the flaws in human nature that bite us again and again, they inevitably settle on Richard III.",10
Richard III,"With a screenplay (co-written by McKellen) that crackles and spits like a roasting pig, it was clearly as much of a blast to make as it is to watch.",10
Richard III,Rarely has a film used London's landmarks so cannily.,10
Richard III,"An outrageous, wickedly funny, 1930s fascist version of the Shakespeare play starring Ian McKellen as Richard of Gloucester.",10
Richard III,"The ""fascist"" staging could have been hackneyed, but Loncraine carries it off superbly as the showcase for action-thriller noir.",10
Richard III,"On its simplest and most satisfying level, Loncraine's Richard III can be enjoyed as an ingeniously sustained and spectacularly ballsy stunt.",10
Strange Days,One of the most fascinating films I’ve ever watched,39
Strange Days,"Fiennes holds steady; his moody, lonely performance, especially in the beguiling first half hour, lends the story an air of calm despair.",39
Strange Days,"This flick is one of Bigelow's very best efforts. Hopefully, the world can finally acknowledge it as the subversive, brilliant work of a master.",39
Strange Days,"It’s a big messy sprawl, and it’s satisfying as only a flawed movie can be.",39
Strange Days,"It proved so ahead of its time, so involved in its myriad of narrative threads, so full of virtuosic formal innovations, so rich in its cultural commentary, and so sybilline in its portrait of the future that its reappraisal seemed inevitable",39
Strange Days,"What this movie is ultimately saying is, don't think at all.",39
Strange Days,The intervening 27 years have bolstered the films reputation as a singular vision of the not-too-distant future.,39
Strange Days,"Strange Days is a careening, high-decibel vision of the near future that combines science fiction, murder mystery and social commentary. It is not entirely successful, but it's a worthy effort.",39
Strange Days,"Strange Days is not a simple film, but a profound sensory experience, where the filmmaker is the prophet of a reality just around the corner.",39
Strange Days,"Kathryn Bigelow's propulsive sci-fi thriller Strange Days is a stone cold, ass-kicking classic.",39
"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar","It succeeds, thanks to the casting of these three macho actors, in the case of Snipes especially, seem to be winking at the audience.",40
"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar","It’s a beautiful hymn to embracing joy, the revolutionary power of a personal style (that has deceptive substance), and the importance of acceptance — both from others and from yourself.",40
"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar","To Wong Foo is a groundbreaking gem film that was ahead of its time in celebrating the beauty and art of drag culture. It balances campy fun with heartfelt moments, touching on serious issues like domestic abuse while humanizing its LGBTQ+ characters.",40
"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar",...complete with a final showdown where queer culture fabulously triumphs over gun culture...,40
"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar","That there’s still a need for candy-movies like ""To Wong Foo"" isn’t really the movie’s fault. It seeks only to entertain, and tangentially to enlighten.",40
"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar","While the backwater town of Snydersville is not necessarily a tourist attraction, some of the road scenes are alluring. And the actors are fab.",40
"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar","The pity is that in this abysmal film, Mr. Swayze’s wonderful performance is wasted.",40
"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar","To Wong Foo... is worthwhile if only for the performances, which are surprisingly good.",40
"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar","To Wong Foo itself struck me as a confused movie. The film had its heart in the right place in that it was trying to make popular audiences like these characters. But in the process of trying to normalize them, it removed all their sexuality.",40
"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar",It just felt like I wanted to see more from these characters toward the end...that's why we started on this journey in the first place...,40
Billy Madison,"Viewed as an absurdist comedy by many, Billy Madison is nonetheless the product of a director who specializes in cautionary tales about the temptations of sin putting one's soul in jeopardy.",41
Billy Madison,"Sandler, who shows every sign of having enough energy to make the grade, should forget about imitating Jim Carrey and find an act of his own.",41
Billy Madison,...an exceedingly (and unabashedly) silly premise that's employed to mostly watchable (yet undeniably erratic) effect by Davis...,41
Billy Madison,A more moronic vehicle is hard to imagine.,41
Billy Madison,"If you've ever had a yen to relive the third grade, this must be the next best thing.",41
Billy Madison,"Billy Madison is a textbook example of a half-decent idea that never got developed beyond the ""lying around drinking beer and making jokes with your buddy"" stage.",41
Billy Madison,The latest entry in the American cinema's investigation of dumb-and-dumber heroes.,41
Billy Madison,"The tepid moments far outnumber the truly wacky ones, and in the end Billy Madison earns a trip to comedy detention.",41
Billy Madison,"While not in the same league as The Wedding Singer, it's still enjoyably dumb fun, especially for Sandler fans.",41
Billy Madison,"Where Dumb And Dumber was clever enough to play dumb to amuse the child in all of us, this suffers under the illusion that just having a central character blissfully unaware of the need for a brain is actually a funny concept.",41
Clerks,"There are still plenty of laughs, but Kevin Smith's third Clerks movie has a lot to say about middle age friendship.",42
Clerks,"So, is Clerks III worth the 16 year wait? It was even better than I, as a longtime fan, could have ever expected",42
Clerks,"The economic anxiety that drove the first movie and remained present in the second is completely absent in the third, and not just because Dante and Randal have become their own bosses.",42
Clerks,"So, yes, Clerks III is a bit of an unfunny mess, and it often highlights Smith's weaknesses as a filmmaker, but when it works, it really, really works.",42
Clerks,Smith does succeed in his apparent goal to make us longtime fans feel mournful and old -- but why did he want to make us feel that way?,42
Clerks,I’m honestly not sure I’ve ever seen a sequel that put less effort into expanding on its source material in any meaningful way.,42
Clerks,"It initially appears to be even more aimless and pointless than Clerks II, but it grows in appeal as it moseys along.",42
Clerks,"I'd be lying if I said ""the sad stuff"" doesn't work, and I'm not one of those critics who's going to downrate something if the emotions are stronger than the aesthetics when that IS the important part.",42
Clerks,"Clerks III might not win Smith many new admirers, but for fans of the original -- and viewers of a certain age -- this will strike enough of a chord to leave you entertained and emotionally satisfied.",42
Clerks,"You could call it “meta,” but I feel like that word deserves something more sophisticated than what’s on the screen. And yet, it works.",42
Disclosure,Ultimately Disclosure is too contrived to be incendiary and not intellectually demanding enough to spark formidable discussion.,43
Disclosure,"It's glossy and hokey, but it is also good storytelling. More importantly, within its aims, it's a lot of fun.",43
Disclosure,Makes the case convincingly that women in power can sexually harass men that they manage.,43
Disclosure,"Douglas inspires little empathy, while Moore's character-a serial sexual harasser-is thinner than a microchip. And as a thriller, Disclosure is anticlimactic...",43
Disclosure,"Though directed with machine-like precision by Barry Levinson, the screenplay by Paul Attanasio unfortunately eliminates too many key elements in Crichton's smart but convoluted story line.",43
Disclosure,Pure and simple trash masquerading as significance.,43
Disclosure,Its preoccupation with snazzy computer-generated special effects has left key plot points so unclear at least one baffled viewer had to retreat to the book to find out why some things happened and others did not.,43
Disclosure,"The presence of Douglas, who has made a career of being pursued by beautiful, dangerous women, turns this sexual-harassment thriller into instant camp.",43
Disclosure,"This witty, wily battle between genders is not so much about sexual harassment as it is about power politics in the workplace, where water-cooler gossip is replaced by E-mail, and where memo warfare is waged by combatants in virtual-reality goggles.",43
Disclosure,"On the level of pure craft, Disclosure is first-rate in every department. Levinson's directing is cogent and colorful, and cinematography by camera wizard Tony Pierce-Roberts is dazzling.",43
Dolores Claiborne,...a slow-moving drama that benefits from its atmospheric visuals and top-notch performances...,44
Dolores Claiborne,"Aided by strong performances, Hackford keeps the suspense simmering nicely until a botched courtroom showdown... Interesting, though, to see Stephen King in the guise of feminist.",44
Dolores Claiborne,"Bates and Jason Leigh both shine in this savvy adaptation of a challenging Stephen King book. Dolores Claiborne proves that when the right people board a project, there's no such thing as an unfilmable book",44
Dolores Claiborne,A delightful yarn.,44
Dolores Claiborne,The story remains compelling even as some of the particulars become obvious before they're revealed.,44
Dolores Claiborne,"A fulfilling score from Danny Elfman and a well-rounded script from Tony Gilroy are met with some superb juxtapositions ranging from the dreary, drab present overshadowed by the events from a rose-tinted past.",44
Dolores Claiborne,It's rare to see a pop best seller come out this well in the movies.,44
Dolores Claiborne,"Dolores Claiborne is a strangely delightful, chilling, and powerful film all at once.",44
Dolores Claiborne,"We should be examining this one again for daringly showcasing how men get away with their impulsivity and evil deeds. Great works of art like this are telling truths we want to bury and forget, but our subconscious won't let us.",44
Dolores Claiborne,"It is well-acted and nicely textured, but scenes of euthanasia and child molestation, a flurry of violence and confusing flashbacks, and Leigh's hard, angry face ensure that it's no barrel of laughs.",44
Eat Drink Man Woman,"Unfortunately, though visually sumptuous, the film is a cold dish.",45
Eat Drink Man Woman,"The food is the star, virtually the only thing to recommend about famed Taiwan-born director Ang Lee's follow-up to his first US hit...",45
Eat Drink Man Woman,Watch a master filmmaker [Ang Lee] hone his craft.,45
Eat Drink Man Woman,The film is seasoned with humor and has a brisk pace. It's pleasing to the eye and stocked with zesty performances all the way around.,45
Eat Drink Man Woman,The constant parallels between food and love are too facile to be illuminating.,45
Eat Drink Man Woman,"A richly textured comedy about the tensions across two generations of a Confucian family, Eat Drink Man Woman typifies the filial focus of Lee's early work",45
Eat Drink Man Woman,A wise and touching piece that matches movies like Babette's Feast and Like Water for Chocolate in its depiction of food as a source of spiritual nourishment.,45
Eat Drink Man Woman,"What makes this a Lee film-and one of his best-is how well he and his co-writers understand all the relationships, and what's going unspoken.",45
Eat Drink Man Woman,"This is a startlingly superior piece of craftsmanship, with the flavour of life and richness of the script conveyed via uniformly wonderful performances.",45
Eat Drink Man Woman,A vivacious comedy about families and how to survive them.,45
Exotica,"As an exploration of trauma and heartbreak, Exotica plumbs the depths of the human heart in ways most films have never dared.",46
Exotica,"It is not a film about sex, but about the emotional impact, a setting provides with its cathartic assistance in healing trauma.",46
Exotica,a master class in complex narrative design in the service of dramatizing the depths of human emotion,46
Exotica,"Egoyan's soft, quiet tones, lived-in spaces, and characters that hide more than they reveal, are still bracing.",46
Exotica,"For all the initial mysteriousness of virtually everyone’s actions, Atom Egoyan is never coy for the sake of being coy.",46
Exotica,A central part of the movie's dreamlike ambience derives from the fact that the camera is in motion in practically every shot.,46
Exotica,Passionless.,46
Exotica,"Atom Egoyan makes his most conventionally-satisfying film in Exotica. I don't mean that as a putdown: it's his best movie, too, though some of his early academic-theory fans may be put off at its accessibility.",46
Exotica,"One of the most despairing movies, and yet there is in the precision of its craft and the depth of its empathy something fundamentally uplifting.",46
Exotica,Egoyan's first Cannes Film Fest entry is an engaging tale of sexual desire and alienation.,46
Ed Wood,Is this Tim Burton’s best movie? It might just be!,47
Ed Wood,"It champions the power of, and passion for, filmmaking by exploring it through the eyes of one of the worst filmmakers to have ever made a motion picture. Burton uses some truly terrible films to inspire what may be his best work.",47
Ed Wood,"While Ed Wood probably won't do the kind of business enjoyed by Edward Scissorhands, this deliciously bizarre bio-pic should instantly become a movie cultist's treasure.",47
Ed Wood,"The sweet center of the movie is Wood's resurrection of horror actor Bela Lugosi, a despairing drug addict who is played brilliantly by Martin Landau.",47
Ed Wood,"What happens when a good filmmaker tries to make a great film about a terrible filmmaker. In the case of Tim Burton's Ed Wood, you get an odd and oddly unsatisfying film with occasional flourishes of brilliance.",47
Ed Wood,"It's pathetic, but Burton does a good job of keeping it entertaining. You might not want to be any of these people, but you don't mind watching.",47
Ed Wood,"The film is not only a hilarious satire of Wood and his low-budget antics, but also a loving paean to dreamers everywhere.",47
Ed Wood,"Tim Burton’s best movie, this unique gem is a gentle valentine that celebrates the creative spirit, no matter how misguided that particular spirit happens to be.",47
Ed Wood,"Ed Wood doesn’t really give us the inside of Wood’s head, but it does treat imaginatively a number of Wood movies that retain a certain fascination ...",47
Ed Wood,"Ed Wood is nevertheless one of the most convincing evocations of the old Hollywood, perhaps (paradoxically) because the re-created universe is so marginal, lacking so much of the traditional Hollywood glamour.",47
Hoop Dreams,An unforgettable and thoroughly engrossing movie that's certainly not just for fans of basketball.,48
Hoop Dreams,"It remains the greatest, most incredibly moving sports documentary ever made...",48
Hoop Dreams,"Recruiters, coaches, teachers–even the boys’ fathers–could be easy targets, but the filmmakers forgo cheap shots.",48
Hoop Dreams,It’s a compelling story that gives you an in depth look at their world.,48
Hoop Dreams,It's the film's humanity which is at the core of its genius. It takes its subject seriously. It never sneers or judges. It sees the context and is wise enough not to hold itself aloof.,48
Hoop Dreams,It's still a miraculous achievement that has rarely been emulated.,48
Hoop Dreams,At once a rigorous exploration of the sports-educational industrial complex and an intimate piece of portraiture...,48
Hoop Dreams,"The film is rich in backstage tension, from Agee's bad grades to Gates's knee injuries, while the glaring social inequality is reflected in the violent fathers and criminal friends who populate the outskirts of the tale.",48
Hoop Dreams,"Perhaps James's biggest achievement is his unshowy emphasis on the poetry of basketball itself: the jump shot, the slam-dunk, ecstatic physical expressions of pure transcendental success.",48
Hoop Dreams,It is impossible to watch this story of kids who have dreams of becoming rich and famous by way of professional basketball without a sense of nostalgia and even sadness.,48
I.Q.,Meg Ryan exudes boffin next door while Tim Robbins combines sensitivity with street savvy and manages to make a science lecture sound like a love sonnet.,49
I.Q.,Ryan and Robbins are miscast in that they both are kooky stars and the script calls for opposites that attract. The scheming is too heavy-handed to be really funny.,49
I.Q.,Half a great movie.,49
I.Q.,"In the last analysis, it's just not clever enough.",49
I.Q.,"Breezy, quirky romcom is predictable but sweet.",49
I.Q.,Walter Matthau makes a captivating and very funny Albert Einstein in this romantic comedy about the iconic scientist playing Cupid for his niece.,49
I.Q.,A charming -- if slightly over-stylized -- romantic comedy about learning to think with your heart instead of your head.,49
I.Q.,"Has been done to death, but there's something endearingly goofy about throwing Einstein, of all people, into the mix that breathes new life into the formula.",49
I.Q.,"It's bad in the way, in fact, of a film that seems a lot like a good movie until you accidentally think about it for just one second.",49
I.Q.,Junk,49
Star Wars,"The Last Jedi is not just a great Star Wars film – it rivals the daring, innovation and thematic richness of even the original trilogy.",50
Star Wars,"The Last Jedi is not only the best film in the Sequel Trilogy by far, but it’s a very natural, very fitting way to continue the story that started with The Force Awakens.",50
Star Wars,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi delivers something that I can be proud of experiencing. Rian Johnson takes a lot of risks with decisions that will make the fanbase debate for years and while I find most of them truly jaw-dropping, a few left me underwhelmed.",50
Star Wars,Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an emotionally-driven culmination of all that came before it and an adoring love letter to George Lucas.,50
Star Wars,"“The Last Jedi” has some early pacing issues and a few things that simply don’t make sense. But it’s still a fantastic Star Wars experience filled with excitement, emotion, and nostalgia.",50
Star Wars,"Johnson's film supplies the requisite spectacle that casual fans expect, while devoted enthusiasts have new, complex ideas to consider for the franchise's future.",50
Star Wars,Star Wars: The Last Jedi was everything I hoped for and more.,50
Star Wars,"Rian Johnson has given us a Star Wars film that actually is a genuine evolution of the series in style, narrative, and emotion.",50

Star Wars,Rian Johnson brings freshness and originality...,50
Legends of the Fall,Brad Pitt leads an epic Western highlighting the sprawling beauty and tragedy of life in this 1994 movie from The Last Samurai director Edward Zwick.,51
Legends of the Fall,"It may take place in a man’s world, but this is a women’s picture, in the vein of the overwrought family epics of the 1950s.",51
Legends of the Fall,The first twenty minutes are incredibly slow but after that I was completely locked in. Anthony Hopkins was robbed of a nomination for this.,51
Legends of the Fall,"While it's a bit overlong, this was a pleasant surprise. I really enjoyed the performances, the cinematography and the story of this family trying to keep it together despite multiple hardships and conflicts. Anthony Hopkins is one of the greatest.",51
Legends of the Fall,Every wisp of wind carries some timbre of a guttural growl of passion.,51
Legends of the Fall,"In general, director Edward Zwick does a commendable job of keeping things apace, while... John Toll's scrumptiously pristine cinematography and James Horner's piercingly full score.",51
Legends of the Fall,What a magnificent piece of old tosh Legends of the Fall is: playing extremely close to a genius pastiche of the melodrama genre.,51
Legends of the Fall,"At first, the picture plays like East of Eden with a bonus brother; it gets sillier as it goes.",51
Legends of the Fall,"The actors fit their roles exceptionally well, but Zwick rarely allows them the kinds of crucial, intimate moments that establish how the characters feel about each other.",51
Legends of the Fall,A weird melodramatic epic -- Bonanza crossbred with the kind of novel that uses Fabio on the cover.,51
"Madness of King George, The","The film, though English in subject matter, was far from English in style. It was grand, not parochial; crude, not genteel, and very funny.",52
"Madness of King George, The",Hawthorne plays madness with restraint. It's only when he hears the news from Yorktown that he goes really bananas.,52
"Madness of King George, The","It's sometimes so loopy that one half-expects Mel Brooks to wander into the frame, muttering, ""It's good to be the king.""",52
"Madness of King George, The","Visually sumptuous, energetic and classy, The Madness of King George is British film theatre at its most seductive.",52
"Madness of King George, The","Hytner's version of Bennett's comic-tragic drama of the tormented king who almost lost his mind confirms that power games, family scandals, and personal intrigues have always been integral to the British Crown, an institution both revered and reviled.",52
"Madness of King George, The",It's Hawthorne's engaging performance that makes this drama both fun and moving.,52
"Madness of King George, The","Vastly entertaining, with more bite than you expect from a costume drama.",52
"Madness of King George, The","Flawless acting. Hawthorne was robbed of an Oscar. Sorry, but it's true.",52
"Madness of King George, The","So slick, so clever and so incredibly lucid that it neither leads to much in the way of thought, discussion or, unfortunately, repeat viewing.",52
"Madness of King George, The","Respectable actors aside, it's no more than a dryasdust history lesson.",52
Natural Born Killers,"A big, dazzling, monstrously violent comedy that is probably the most extreme movie ever made in Hollywood. Psychedelic and assaultive, it's like a fever dream snatched from the skull of Charles Manson.",53
Natural Born Killers,"Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers is a passionately mad, frequently bad, passably interesting, probably unmissable movie.",53
Natural Born Killers,"The intent is manifestly satirical, though the result is lumbering and mirthless.",53
Natural Born Killers,"In Stone's last virtuoso display piece, JFK, the technical fireworks served a firm dramatic purpose. Here they get horribly out of hand. The flimsy, derivative storyline becomes almost obliterated.",53
Natural Born Killers,"Stone's talent works well on the eye, seldom on the brain. There's no coherent argument to follow in his film; nothing lasts long lest viewers' attention span parts company with the excitement under the strain of having to follow a thesis.",53
Natural Born Killers,It's Stone's sordid but well-executed action pic message film about how an ill-informed society glorifies repulsive violent figures and makes them heroes.,53
Natural Born Killers,"As a visceral piece of moviemaking, it’s astonishing, but Its message that mass murder begets fawning media coverage and vice versa was already becoming moldy in the mid-90s.",53
Natural Born Killers,"America may be obsessed with violence, but not nearly to the depth of depravity in which filmmaker Oliver Stone wallows in Natural Born Killers.",53
Natural Born Killers,"Harrelson and Lewis turn in chilling performances as the vapid, thrill-seeking, amoral couple. Though we don't in any way identify with them, we can identify them.",53
Natural Born Killers,"…this story of criminal youth gone mad in an even madder world was strong meat in 1995, and still retains some political edge in 2023…",53
"Professional, The","As an action thriller, often stylized with violence and irony, never loses its pulse or sense of intrigue as it explores the urban tale about the professional killer who protects the orphan girl in the corrupt streets of New York. [Full review in Spanish]",55
"Professional, The","‘…Leon: The Professional is notable for a trio of iconic performances from Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman, the latter setting a gold standard for manic villainy that’s rarely been bettered…’",55
"Professional, The",...a mostly enthralling thriller that captures the viewer’s interest and attention from the word go...,55
"Professional, The","There's a surprising amount of depth, drama, and affection for a film marketed primarily as a shoot-'em-up thriller.",55
"Professional, The",... the awesomeness of some of its scenes like the final showdown which is just breathtaking in its beautiful violence.,55
"Professional, The","Unquestionably, Leon is an absolute masterpiece with some jaw-dropping performances from Natalie Portman, Jean Reno, and a turned-up-to-11 Gary Oldman.",55
"Professional, The","Luc Besson's first English-language hit is, like much of the Frenchman's work, less than subtle, yet it is stylish, disturbing and weirdly moving.",55
"Professional, The","The tricky character dynamics, remarkable performances, and thrilling action of Leon has never been topped in Besson's 30+ year career.",55
"Professional, The",Holds up as an exciting and dangerous ride through a city that still exists in the mind.,55
"Professional, The","Leon: The Professional is a wonderful character study, enriched by outstanding performances, thrilling action, and a well-rounded script that gives the film an intriguing amount of depth.",55
Pulp Fiction,"Super cool, totally thrilling, and a startling blend of homage and originality that has not been matched since—once you see it, you’ll never view cinema the same way again.",56
Pulp Fiction,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction not only remains his best movie, but is an exhilarating crime saga full of great performances and energetic writing.",56
Pulp Fiction,"... A controversial yet award-worthy combination of gorgeous dialogue, genre-literacy, guns and gore.",56
Pulp Fiction,"Pulp Fiction may not be perfect (the Butch sequence struggles to reach the heights of the others). However, its highs are among the very best in cinema history.",56
Pulp Fiction,... a film that twists and turns and double backs on itself with the sheer delight of a narrative magician.,56
Pulp Fiction,"Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking.",56
Pulp Fiction,Rarely have I left a movie theatre more thrilled or invigorated as I did after leaving Pulp Fiction.,56
Pulp Fiction,"There is a fine madness to writer/director/actor Quentin Tarantino's latest wonderwork, Pulp Fiction, which is certainly one of the most exciting films of the past 20 years and easily the most important film of 1994.",56
Pulp Fiction,"Unlike his first film, Reservoir Dogs, whose genius lay in its ability to shock and dazzle, Pulp Fiction penetrates the glib surface of style, allusion, and machismo to the murky meaning of these things.",56
Pulp Fiction,There's a special kick that comes from watching something this thrillingly alive.,56
Priest,"It seems no matter how hard star Paul Bettany tries to establish himself as an action hero, he keeps choosing poor scripts.",57
Priest,"The film looks good and the action sequences have zip, but the characters are underdeveloped and the dialogue is dire.",57
Priest,"Paul Bettany is an intriguing choice as Priest, but his performance is so devoid of life that it might as well have been Brandon Routh.",57
Priest,"The movie Priest was a surprisingly racist, semi-coherent piece of mindless Hollywood idiocy, complete with genocidal fantasies, derivative Blade-Runner-future stylings, and please-please-please-grant-us-a-sequel tripe ending.",57
Priest,There isn't anything here that is nurtured enough to resonate either emotionally or mythologically once the film is over.,57
Priest,"It's everything you've enjoyed in every genre film you've ever seen rolled into one package, although it seems to lose something when added into the sum of its parts.",57
Priest,"It's just a shame this world is populated with such one-dimensional, humourless characters.",57
Priest,"Even with hives of cool-looking vampires, cowboys on motorcycles, and ninja priests, there are some stories that are just too dumb to live.",57
Priest,Another broad yet eclectic little genre-blender to (maybe) toss into your rental queue.,57
Priest,Priest is one of those films you will forget about approximately five minutes after it's over. There is absolutely nothing memorable here.,57
Quiz Show,"Robert Redford's soft-spoken, intelligent but never less than entertaining movie reminds us of exactly what we've been missing -- a story that seems utterly fresh and a filmmaking style best described as civilized.",58
Quiz Show,"The movie hums, purrs and shines. But it's also full of contradictions. A big budget picture about mass media fakery that's somewhat rigged itself, a docudrama that stretches the facts, an exposé on class prejudice that almost succumbs to [that] vice.",58
Quiz Show,"Fiennes' ability to project the pain behind a well-mannered facade, to turn intellectual and emotional agony into a real and living thing, is devastating. Impressive as the film is... Quiz Show would have been a very different experience without him.",58
Quiz Show,"For all of its occasional naiveté, this is a movie that practices what it preaches: It's a fine, worthy film, devoid of pandering or commercial compromise, that allows a number of talented people do some very good work.",58
Quiz Show,"A class act -- a big, important film, more relevant than ever, questioning the ways art and information and truth are rejiggered by TV as it increasingly blurs the line between news and entertainment.",58
Quiz Show,"What's so good about Robert Redford's sleek version of the story is how delicately such issues as motive and emotions are sketched, and how ambiguity, not glib moralizing, is prized.",58
Quiz Show,"The heart-stopping performance is that of Paul Scofield as Van Doren's poet father, Mark, who brings the full measure of patrician spine and patriarchal despair to the part of a famous father seeing his son chase after false fame.",58
Quiz Show,"If you were truly shocked when you found out NBC blew up a ""faulty"" truck in order to get exciting video, well, then Quiz Show may chill you to the bone. Everyone else can enjoy it simply as an example of impeccable moviemaking.",58
Quiz Show,"It's a very good movie, just short of greatness, carried along on outstanding performances by John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes, and Robert Redford's simple, evocative direction.",58
Quiz Show,"The true star of Quiz Show is Redford, who had demonstrated fine directorial talent but achieves striking heights here. The movie works on so many levels it's almost dizzying.",58
Three Colors: Red,It is a warning of what may come if we isolate ourselves from others and cut off communication.,59
Three Colors: Red,"The film's use of colour and sound is unparalleled in 1990s cinema, while the intricate plot linking model Jacob with snooping judge Jean-Louis Trintignant is spellbinding.",59
Three Colors: Red,"... the rich red color scheme brings a vibrancy to the scenes: it's the color of love, anger, passion, heat, and it warms this into becoming the most forgiving film in the series.",59
Three Colors: Red,Three Colors remains an unshakable entry in cinema...,59
Three Colors: Red,"It is an almost supernatural contrivance: brooding on coincidence, fate and the insoluble mystery of other people’s lives...",59
Three Colors: Red,"Three Colours: Red is the trilogy’s anti-romance, depicting an unconventional love story blossoming against the insurmountable obstacle of age -- perhaps the most adventurous and personal of the trilogy.",59
Three Colors: Red,"If Blue was steeped in melancholy and White appeared frosty in tone, Red positively vibrates with a ruddy passion.",59
Three Colors: Red,"...connected with the French themes of liberty, equality, and fraternity and touch on different subjects...",59
Three Colors: Red,"...the film’s most impressive feat is its metaphysical connection with the medium itself, the cinema, which is also about coming together and sharing experiences.",59
Three Colors: Red,"As ever, life’s mysteries are affirmed, fate often inexplicable even if morality remains (fairly) fixed.",59
Three Colors: Blue,"Kieślowski makes it feel like a dream, that is slowly fading away from memory.",60
Three Colors: Blue,"Juliette Binoche gives an intense yet sensitive performance as the survivor of a car crash that killed her family, who discovers that, no matter how great her pain, she doesn't have the freedom to give up life.",60
Three Colors: Blue,"Kieslowski and his usual co-writer, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, portray loneliness, emotional paralysis, and the devastation of the soul as has rarely been done in the history of cinema. [Full review in Spanish]",60
Three Colors: Blue,"Juliette Binoche as Julie, a bereaved heroine, nearly saves this existential rehash. With her somnambulistic stares and her ability to make silence a palpable experience, she gives a badly overwrought film some moments of real profundity.",60
Three Colors: Blue,"The saturated hues are calming, protective, but also isolating; the rest of the world fades away when she's enveloped in the blue of the water.",60
Three Colors: Blue,The film is almost totally schematic and this weakens it. What strengthens it is the sheer emotional power of its making.,60
Three Colors: Blue,"Grand reminders of the little motions that gather slowly but surely, to deliver the quick, sudden turns that give even the most indolent life meaning.",60
Three Colors: Blue,"The score from Zbigniew Preisner is extraordinary, the opening motorway crash sequence is terrifying and the final close-up, as Julie is ultimately reconciled to her fate, is unutterably moving.",60
Three Colors: Blue,"Like delving into a cold cave of human emotion, Three Colours: Blue is the jewel in the crown of Kieślowski’s trilogy – a fascinating examination of freedom, sorrow and identity, and perhaps one of the most necessary films of contemporary French cinema.",60
Three Colors: Blue,There is something so rich and spacious and unhurried here. There is a wonderful reach and flair in Kieślowski’s film-making.,60
Three Colors: White,"Overall, White is often regarded as the weakest film in the trilogy, but that is hardly fair. White has a lot to analyse and a lot of themes to discuss. This is a highly enjoyable film, set in a bleak world, where things aren’t in black and white.",61
Three Colors: White,"Although a comedy, White is an examination of the aftermath of the Communist regime in Poland under which everyone was supposed to be equal.",61
Three Colors: White,"White is very strange for a long time and in the end, everything makes sense. [Full review in Spanish]",61
Three Colors: White,"[T]his is the comedy of the trilogy, not so much a black comedy as a wicked satire in the cold white light of Polish winter, which (as you would expect) informs the color palette of this film.",61
Three Colors: White,"Its remastering of these three films is stunning, given that these films are rich in their coloring and textures. Images are sharp, crisp, and vibrant, bringing to life the lush color tones that saturate these films.",61
Three Colors: White,What a strange confection White is – an opera of male agony and outrageously implausible picaresque adventure. Yet it succeeds amazingly on its own melodramatic terms.,61
Three Colors: White,"Often overlooked due to its more jovial and subtle approach, Three Colours: White is a surprisingly affecting story that whilst not delivering as strong an emotional hammer blow as Three Colours: Blue is just as an important study of French society.",61
Three Colors: White,"It’s not as absorbing as its two celluloid compatriots in the trilogy, but it’s entertaining (and clever) enough in its own right.",61
Three Colors: White,The finale to a storied career with one of cinema’s most artistic accomplishments of the century.,61
Three Colors: White,"The somber, lyrical, metaphysical questioning that dominates Kieslowski’s sensibility is much more playfully deployed in White...",61
Stargate,Not enough of the plot was designed well enough to stand out from the pack of other ’90s sci-fi flicks; creative complications are simply far too few.,62
Stargate,"Emmerich's film may not be a lot of things, but as an action-packed, science-fiction rollercoaster ride, it's fabulous fun.",62
Stargate,The spirit of adventure keeps the cheesy parts fun.,62
Stargate,"Loud and convoluted, and unless you get off on special effects the only reason to see it is James Spader.",62
Stargate,"An ungainly, but interesting blend of sci-fiction and an old-fashioned, sandblown desert epic.",62
Stargate,...an entertaining sci-fi thriller...,62
Stargate,"Stargate is a blast from the past in many ways, but it imaginatively employs the latest special effects technology to give audiences new thrills.",62
Stargate,"The kind of flick where Kurt Russell dispatches an Anubis-looking baddie after first telling him, in the kind of bon mot that elevates the thing an entire letter grade, ""Give my regards to King Tut, a**hole.""",62
Stargate,'Stargate' is a prime entertainment whose two hours of footage passes very quickly. [Full Review in Spanish],62
Stargate,"It works not because ridiculousness is concealed, but because ridiculousness on this scale becomes something else. Don't let anyone tell you that Stargate, lifeless script and all, isn't clunky fun, proudly trembling on the brink of classic camp.",62
"Santa Clause, The","I'm not going to be the movie critic who gives Santa Claus a bad review. Not me. It's not up to the first two, but it's fine for kids, and Short is terrific.",63
"Santa Clause, The",Magical (if mindless) family holiday fun.,63
"Santa Clause, The",You look at a movie like this and wonder how some screenwriters can have the temerity to go on strike,63
"Santa Clause, The","Special effects are in abundance, but none of them are very well-produced, much like the film on the whole.",63
"Santa Clause, The",It's sad to see the life sucked out of a series that started so well.,63
"Santa Clause, The","Short's skill and total commitment to his role make him no straw-dog villain, and his chemistry with Allen helps the movie's Santa feel like a real live person and not an imperturbable icon.",63
"Santa Clause, The","Frost turns the occasion into a swag-saturated consumer orgy, which the film condemns even as it hams up product placement for Red Bull.",63
"Santa Clause, The","While it may concern elves and Christmas, 'The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause' is more dreary than cheery.",63
"Santa Clause, The",There is no escaping the banality of it all.,63
"Santa Clause, The","A little muddled and derivative but what do we expect, really?",63
"Shawshank Redemption, The","[The Shawshank Redemption] is the cinematic equivalent of therapy, showcasing the power of vulnerability.",64
"Shawshank Redemption, The",The Shawshank Redemption is as beautiful and genuine now as it was in its initial overlooked run.,64
"Shawshank Redemption, The","Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption is not only still one of the best Stephen King adaptations, but also a wonderful exploration of hope.",64
"Shawshank Redemption, The",Deakins’s work here began his run of 16 Oscar nominations... it’s a crucial part of Shawshank’s enduring legacy.,64
"Shawshank Redemption, The",... a faith-based movie without any faith.,64
"Shawshank Redemption, The","Darabont cut right to the heart of a flock of human birds trapped in a giant cage, under the watch of a corrupt warden and terrifyingly sinister guard. It was serious, certain, and made you laugh. Freeman's legend has never shined brighter.",64
"Shawshank Redemption, The",If this is a feel-good movie -- and by the end it certainly is -- then at least it challenges us to dig deep for those good feelings when everything inside those mausoleum walls is unrelievedly harsh and grey.,64
"Shawshank Redemption, The","The Shawshank Redemption is both resigned and inspirational, grittily realistic and vaguely surreal, matter-of-fact and operatic. Somehow, these opposites are combined into a remarkably smooth and lyrical composition.",64
"Shawshank Redemption, The","The sad thing is that The Shawshank Redemption, a so-so film, would have made a terrific little movie. A pacier project would have given us less time to notice sentimentalities.",64
"Shawshank Redemption, The","Next to Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption ranks as the strongest, purest film ever made from a novel or novella by Stephen King, a monster film where the horrors are frighteningly human.",64

What's Eating Gilbert Grape,A blissful slice of Americana...,65
What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"Grape makes a lasting impression with its quirky performances and bittersweet themes of hope, humility and perseverance.",65
What's Eating Gilbert Grape,This emphasis on character and texture is full of pleasurable rewards-especially when the astonishing DiCaprio is on-screen-and there's enough growth and compassion to keep it from being a Diane Arbus freak show come to life.,65
What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"Despite Depp's tender melancholy, the performers who stay with you are those who dare to crack the surface of their characters' alienation.",65
What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"Although DiCaprio is the one who ends up getting more attention from the public due to the enormous performance, the movie gives life to a restrained Johnny Depp. [Full Review in Spanish]",65
What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"Though it takes dark twists and turns to an inevitable climax, What's Eating Gilbert Grape will leave you feeling full and satisfied with a renewed sense of the value in family.",65
What's Eating Gilbert Grape,The realistic depiction of marginalized characters overcoming grief and accepting disabilities is what makes this film timeless.,65
What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"Gilbert Grape has body and deep flavor, but it can be wonderfully dry too.",65
What's Eating Gilbert Grape,Depp is subtly winning as a man-child oblivious to his own pent-up rage. But the performance that will take your breath away is DiCaprio's.,65
While You Were Sleeping,...an increasingly compelling and charming romantic comedy...,66
While You Were Sleeping,Rom Com / screwball comedy perfection.,66
While You Were Sleeping,"Like most American romantic comedies, this is all heart and no head, but it does have a habit of sneaking in some intriguing twists and turns when you least expect it.",66
While You Were Sleeping,Bullock gives Lucy just the right amount of edge. Pullman's performance as Peter's down-to-earth younger brother is also a deft mix of moxie and frustration.,66
While You Were Sleeping,"I don't buy it, and it's the kind of plot that genuinely leaves me cold.",66
While You Were Sleeping,The script is actually really solid and the performances are so likable.,66
While You Were Sleeping,It's practically certain to lull moviegoers into a pleasant state of dreamy bliss.,66
While You Were Sleeping,The heart of the film's charm is Sandra Bullock.,66
While You Were Sleeping,[Bullock] knows one of the secrets of doing romantic comedy: treating the romance as a good joke.,66
While You Were Sleeping,"Compared to While You Were Sleeping, even the half-baked scenario of the Marisa Tomei-Robert Downey Jr. romance Only You looks witty and inventive.",66
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,"Ace Ventura is puerile, brain-numbing and forgettable.",67
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,The twist ending is unnecessary and has the unsavory side effect of teaching millions of young Ace fans that it’s unimaginably gross for a man to kiss a trans woman ­­ — this from a movie whose hero talks out of his butt.,67
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,For those who do not see a hint of humor...Provokes the unsettling sensation of being in the middle of a jovial and merry asylum. [Full review in Spanish],67
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,It's a one-man show that doesn't need to be toned down so much as its skits need to be better embellished and decorated.,67
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,The surprisingly enjoyable family comedy that catapulted Jim Carrey to fame and fortune as the most popular funnyman of the 1990s.,67
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,Your reaction to this fast and furious farce will largely depend on whether you find Carrey's distinctive style of extremely physical comedy -- often compared to that of Jerry Lewis -- stupidly hilarious or downright annoying.,67
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,"Put a leash on Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and call it a dog. This mangy comedy showcase for funnyman Jim Carrey trots through virtually every lowbrow laugh-getter imaginable, short of hiking its leg over a fire hydrant.",67
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,"Playing a celebrated finder of missing mammals, [Carrey's] so over-energized from the start you keep thinking he'll wear out his welcome pronto; 90 minutes later his lunacy is still hard to take your eyes off.",67
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,"Replete with rude noises, pathetic table manners and bathroom jokes that would discredit a second grader, Ace Ventura is an endeavor that all concerned should omit from their résumés.",67
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,Director Tom Shadyac's film belongs to Carrey. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective proves he is more than a TV sketch artist. Carrey's a comic find.,67
"Crow, The",a shot of pure happiness.,68
Forrest Gump,"Flaws and all, the movie unfolds like a book of short stories and that choice ushered in a confidence the script is able to pull off.",69
Forrest Gump,"When analyzing the ultimate endurance that “Forrest Gump” has left in the decades since it first came out, it’s obvious that approaching it with a more inquisitive perspective leaves it with a much shallower impact than it did upon its initial release.",69
Forrest Gump,"Forrest Gump is Hollywood film-making at its most corn-fed, sucrose-enriched and calorific; you’ll need a sweet tooth for it.",69
Forrest Gump,Forrest was an ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances.,69
Forrest Gump,"Zemeckis has made a fast movie about a slow hero; he transforms Forrest's daffy misconceptions into lyrical flights. Forrest Gump has a softer, more delicate touch and a richer current of feeling than any of the other holy-innocent movies.",69
Forrest Gump,"What makes Forrest Gump a stunning triumph, a departure from the mediocre norm? A big reason is the way the film provides a fresh perspective on the familiar experience, through the eyes of its unforgettable protagonist.",69
Forrest Gump,"Forrest Gump isn't a movie for cynics. Instead, it's one of those rare films that seduces viewers into overlooking its faults with the sheer goodness of its heart.",69

Forrest Gump,"Forrest Gump is for big kids what playing Nintendo is for little ones -- that is, the neato thing about Robert Zemeckis' film is the clever techno-wizardry produced by Ken Ralston and Industrial Light and Magic.",69
Four Weddings and a Funeral,"Mike Newell, director of Enchanted April, has made an even more charming movie. Richard Curtis' screenplay shuffles at least 20 characters, all outlined with strict economy. [Full review in Spanish]",70
Four Weddings and a Funeral,"Like the best champagne, Four Weddings and a Funeral goes to the head quickly. And like the best champagne, it leaves fizzy memories and almost no hangover.",70
Four Weddings and a Funeral,The script by Blackadder’s Richard Curtis and direction by Mike Newell give this comical romantic froth such an eager whisk that it stands up and assaults the taste buds.,70
Four Weddings and a Funeral,"This is a glorious, entertaining, fast-moving, hilarious comedy, packed with great jokes, scattered like confetti and delivered by a cast who act their socks off.",70
Four Weddings and a Funeral,"It is smart and ironic, perceptive and observant, witty and poignant, moving and sad, all at the same time. This is more than an accomplishment for a romantic comedy. This is a small miracle.",70
Four Weddings and a Funeral,"Newell, a director like Stephen Frears who has no particular style but fits his undoubted expertise to the material, has to be congratulated not only for getting such good performances but for the pace and verve with which he lays out the absurdities.",70
Four Weddings and a Funeral,"No matter, however, that plot likelihood is unconvincing. Grant's nuanced comic style survives it. Easy to see why America has gone for him.",70
Four Weddings and a Funeral,"Four Weddings and a Funeral is so full of elegant bounce that you aren't always aware of what a splendid balancing act it is. It's sly, libidinous, sunny, quick and altogether beguiling.",70
Four Weddings and a Funeral,The Richard Curtis screenplay is as tightly wound as the springs on alarm clocks -- the ones that never seem to wake Charles early enough to get him to the church on time.,70
Four Weddings and a Funeral,"Four Weddings and a Funeral, which is structured like a film student's senior project, strives to be more than that and ends up as something worse: a smarmy little fable about the magic of true love.",70
"Mask, The","Behind the Mask strikes surprising thematic gold, while also worshipping the genre. Glosserman’s shell game approach leaves the audience with clear messages, all while providing enough easter eggs and homages to satisfy the hardcore genre fans.",72
"Mask, The","The film is more a comedy than a horror film, and a very very funny one at that",72
"Mask, The","It's cool to see that he didn't chain himself to the limitations of the mockumentary format. I've actually never seen a film shot like this, so that's pretty cool.",72
"Mask, The",This film proves why deconstructing a genre you love isn't always necessarily a negative. It can help us learn how to love it even more.,72
"Mask, The","The movie is a lot of fun, as well as a prime example of how to pump new life into an old formula.",72
"Mask, The",...it's ultimately the underwhelming execution that confirms the movie's place as an almost total misfire.,72
"Mask, The",[A] terrific little pearl of a satiric horror-comedy.,72
"Mask, The","A pure horror film masterpiece, and slasher fans would be best to acknowledge it.",72
"Mask, The","A rather funny ""Scream""-like cross between a mockumentary and a direct-to-video slasher movie, ""Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon"" is custom-made for horror fans, but it isn't remotely scary and people that aren't already steeped in the lore of t",72
"Mask, The","Other than displaying a textbook awareness of its ancestors, Behind the Mask offers next to nothing",72
Maverick,"It is generally said that the second parts are not good, however, Top Gun Maverick is fortunately an exception to this rule, it is even considered that in terms of the level of action and intrigue it may even be superior...",73
Maverick,"After 36 years, Tom Cruise returns as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell and proved to fans (and critics) of the first Top Gun that a long-awaited sequel can be entertaining, deserved, and of high quality.",73

Maverick,"Top Gun: Maverick is the rare legacy sequel that eclipses the original in every way possible, thanks to mind-blowing action and great character growth.",73
Maverick,"“Top Gun: Maverick,” if anything, proves that old-school big-budget blockbuster cinema that takes itself seriously isn’t just sorely missing from the yearly cinematic roster but still has the power to stand on its own.",73
Maverick,Ohh right this is what movies used to be like.,73
Maverick,Top Gun: Maverick is the reason why I go to the movies and why Tom Cruise is the biggest movie star in the world. WHAT. A RIDE.,73
Maverick,"Maverick dished out generous amounts of bromance, action, and a truly-immersive narrative in swashbuckling style, and Cruise’s iconic grin was still the greatest thing to take away from it.",73
Maverick,It is all of the flying sequences that are shot in such a way that it makes the moviegoer feel like they are a passenger that gives the movie its energy and makes it so much fun.,73
Maverick,Top Gun: Maverick is a surprising stunner crafted with pure adrenaline and kerosene.,73
Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!,"A little Meyer goes a long way, but this is one of his more coherent and -- in a peculiar way -- restrained essays in trash madness.",74
Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!,"Although the plot is risible and the acting Cro-Magnon, the film is brilliantly shot, throbbing with raw energy and skewed humor.",74
Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!,"It is great if you’re into cheap, trashy movies. Who could ask for more?",74
Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!,"Once considered porn-ish, the flick has now gained quite a few feminist credentials.",74
Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!,"A mystery, exploitation film, and hot rod thriller all rolled into one busty package.",74
Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!,A bizarrely campy film that could (and would) serve as inspiration for other filmmakers (most notably Quentin Tarantino) more than it can succeed as entertainment by itself.,74
Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!,"So many exclamation marks, so little time.",74
Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!,"Sadly, Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! sounds far better on paper than it actually plays.",74
Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!,Russ Meyer's fetishistic vision of powerful bisexual amazons of mixed nationalities engaged in criminal super action exists in a cartoonish world of black and white humor where anything is possible,74
Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!,"Gleefully sordid, violent, good-humored exploitation from Russ Meyer, the thinking person's skin-flick director.",74
Brother Minister: The Assassination of Malcolm X,A captivating documentary.,75
Carlito's Way,"The film proved that the director hadn't lost his touch, despite controversy that he had cast an Italian-American--and not for the first time--as a Latino character. Unsteady accent aside, Pacino's heartfelt performance helped to win over many skeptics",76
Carlito's Way,"Pacino and especially Penn are terrific, and De Palma again masterminds a pair of superb set-pieces.",76
Carlito's Way,"The performances here are what needs to be viewed, they make the film what it is. They are powerful and just right...",76
Carlito's Way,"Dreams can die but nightmares can flourish, an understanding brought about by the disillusionment that every De Palma hero experiences.",76
Carlito's Way,...a top-tier endeavor from a decidedly erratic filmmaker.,76
Carlito's Way,"Carlito's sincerity, severity, and confidence - matched once again with the poetry of lavish tumult - are thoroughly engaging.",76
Carlito's Way,"The film's somber mood is balanced only by its larger-than-life performances, retro '70s threads, thrilling sequences, and plenty of sweaty disco tunes outside of Patrick Doyle's stellar score.",76
Carlito's Way,"Carlito's Way, Brian De Palma's return to the dangerous, violent world of Latino crime, marks yet another advance in the remarkable second act of Al Pacino's career.",76
Carlito's Way,"You expect a fine performance from Pacino, and, with hopeless, hollowed-out eyes, he gives it. You expect the worst from Sean Penn. But, here, he's a hit.",76
Carlito's Way,"Penn, in curled hair and wire-rims, makes a brilliant, slippery high-end shyster; his modulated hysteria is amazing. So is Brian De Palma's direction.",76
"Firm, The","Cruise’s toothy heroics are ill-suited to moral complexity, but he is elevated by a stellar supporting cast...",77
"Firm, The",Those who admired the book will despise the movie and vice versa. [Full review in Spanish],77
"Firm, The","The first adaptation of a John Grisham novel to top the box office, The Firm successfully feels like a mass-market page-turner.",77
"Firm, The","Tom Cruise is blessed with the amazing ensemble... and a screenplay contribution from Robert Towne, yet the result is a pat paper chase-cum-thriller that's looking constantly to break the surface.",77
"Firm, The","A summer genre movie for grown-ups, The Firm helps restore faith in Hollywood professionalism.",77
"Firm, The",The Firm is soft -- lumpy in its plotting and almost silly at times.,77
"Firm, The",...a completely passable adaptation that never quite becomes the classic legal thriller it wants to be.,77
"Firm, The","...pits Cruise against the world, with only his character's wit.",77
"Firm, The",Too-long Grisham thriller is full of adult themes.,77
"Firm, The",Tom Cruise heads a tony cast in a best-seller movie that is firm at the start and infirm by the end.,77
Free Willy,"Like all memorable children's films, this one will bring tears to the eyes of parents and kids alike as it deals with the eternal themes of love, loss, trust and forgiveness.",78
Free Willy,"There's something to be said for fairy tales--when they're done with breadth and emotion. At its best, ""Free Willy"" jumps that barrier.",78
Free Willy,"Despite a clichéd plot and some ropey performances, this is still a well-made and entertaining children's film.",78
Free Willy,"It's pretty hard to resist once Keiko and Jason James Richter are on screen together, providing you're between four and ten at heart.",78
Free Willy,"With a phony kid and boring whale, there isn't much to recommend in ""Free Willy.""",78
Free Willy,"This movie itself is a very special case, a wonderful, timeless story of a boy's struggle to become part of a family.",78
Free Willy,"The movie floats along on Willy's boisterous animal magnetism, but its human drama is only serviceable.",78
Free Willy,A wayward boy befriends a moody killer whale.,78
Free Willy,"""Free Willy"" is an exhilarating drama of boy and nature that unabashedly pulls at the heart strings. Thankfully, its creators know just what to do emotionally and technically to pull off this old-fashioned sentimental yarn.",78
Free Willy,Save the whale! Still a good family film with a great Michael Jackson title song.,78
"Fugitive, The","The film doesn't present much in the way of evidence against Ghosn, so the conclusion we are left with is ambiguous at best.",79
"Fugitive, The","Curious, how this documentary turns into narrative mush in its last half-hour... it’s a lot of empty assertions.",79
"Fugitive, The",The documentary Fugitive: The Curious Case of Carlos Ghosn covers little to no new ground on the subject but offers a thorough look at this man’s rise.,79
Hot Shots! Part Deux,...an agreeable yet perpetually erratic comedy that’s barely able to justify its already-short running time...,80
Hot Shots! Part Deux,…a fittingly silly finale to a series that never lost its momentum…,80
Hot Shots! Part Deux,"The film fields the usual suspects (Lloyd Bridges notably), and many, but not nearly enough, of the usual jokes.",80
Hot Shots! Part Deux,"As it charges along to its disappointingly hollow payoff, Part Deux grows increasingly violent, with a graphic in one corner of the screen toting up kills like a video game",80
Hot Shots! Part Deux,It's beautiful.,80
Hot Shots! Part Deux,This is a long way from the inspirations of Airplane!,80
Hot Shots! Part Deux,"If the original Hot Shots! was the mother of all movies, its sequel ... might well be considered the aunt of all movies ... or at least the first cousin of Rambo.",80
Hot Shots! Part Deux,"Pretty funny, but too much forced zaniness, jokes upon jokes, many tasteless.",80
Hot Shots! Part Deux,"Unlike its grim predecessor, there are at least two chuckles this time round.",80
Hot Shots! Part Deux,It is what it is. The Saddam jokes get a bit tired by movie's end.,80
"Hudsucker Proxy, The","The film doesn't have anything you'd recognize as content, but it is as precisely made as a wonderful machine, funny in a mode of zany giddiness, and boasts both a German expressionist sensibility and an angel who smokes a cigar.",81
"Hudsucker Proxy, The",There is more intelligence and inventiveness in any random five minutes of a film by Joel and Ethan Coen than you can find in an entire year's worth of movies from some studios I can think of.,81
"Hudsucker Proxy, The","...The Hudsucker Proxy feels positively Capra-esque (well, a hair twisted on that ethos) as its the most loving homage the brothers made to the actual Golden Age films that inspired them...",81
"Hudsucker Proxy, The","The Hudsucker Proxy will have people saying ""they don't make 'em like that anymore."" Of course, with the Coens' simultaneously sage and silly vision, they never made 'em like that to begin with. The Hudsucker Proxy is a singularly spectacular film.",81
"Hudsucker Proxy, The","The Coens turn a classic Horatio Alger tale into a hilariously off-kilter pastiche of pastiches. The more you love movies, the more gags you'll catch.",81
"Hudsucker Proxy, The","The Coens should be applauded, not spanked, for their virtuoso playfulness.",81
"Hudsucker Proxy, The","What's wrong with The Hudsucker Proxy, though, is that, for all its craftsmanship it is an utterly soulless enterprise. The Coens wisely show no inclination to parody their sources here, but neither do they seem to have anything else in mind for them.",81
"Hudsucker Proxy, The",...has an unexpected sense of benevolence.,81
"Hudsucker Proxy, The","I have, minimally, enjoyed every film from the Coen Brothers, yet in my eyes The Hudsucker Proxy is the finest of all of them.",81
"Hudsucker Proxy, The","Dark Coen Brothers screwball comedy has suicide, smoking.",81
Jurassic Park,"Jurassic Park gives everything you could ask of a blockbuster adventure movie, and much of what you might ask of a horror movie. The thrills are executed sharply, and strike the perfect tone when juxtaposed against moments of wonder and true movie magic.",82
Jurassic Park,"Jurassic Park remains timeless because the issues it chose to explore are universal, while Alan, Ian, Ellie and the other heroes remain relatable, despite their extraordinary circumstances.",82
Jurassic Park,An amazing ride.,82
Jurassic Park,"Even with sequels of debatable merit weighing it down, Spielberg's original 1993 movie can't be stopped.",82
Jurassic Park,A magical marvel of blockbuster cinema.,82
Jurassic Park,"Watching the film in 2023 brings with it some unusual baggage. Questions about control, computer hacking, and what to do with the power you’ve discovered seem more relevant than ever.",82
Jurassic Park,"Groundbreaking FX, an all star cast, some of the most iconic action/horror sequences ever filmed, and just the right amount of critique of traditional gender roles & capitalism. Jurassic Park truly is a four quadrant blockbuster",82
Jurassic Park,"Jurassic Park is a legendary film full of a number of scary set pieces, but its most frightening sequence is one without dinosaurs.",82
Jurassic Park,"It has a thrill or two, and a chill or three, but it has no poetry, little sense of wonder, no resonant subtext, no art.",82
Jurassic Park,“Jurassic Park” turned out to be an incredible visual achievement and a groundbreaking step forward for movie technology.,82
Much Ado About Nothing,My favorite Shakespeare adaptation of all time,83
Much Ado About Nothing,"It might not be set to the music of ABBA, but with Patrick Doyle’s radiant score, an intoxicatingly beautiful Tuscan setting, and an infectious, non-stop party vibe, the joyous Much Ado About Nothing feels [...] akin to Mamma Mia",83
Much Ado About Nothing,Much Ado About Nothing is one of the few movies of recent years that could leave its audiences weeping with joy.,83
Much Ado About Nothing,What a piece of work is this.,83
Much Ado About Nothing,"Imaginative, intelligent, and brilliantly filmed, Branagh's Much Ado... is likely to make many people-especially the young-understand that Shakespeare can be vital, interesting, moving, and fun.",83
Much Ado About Nothing,"Doyle's enrapturing music and Branagh's cinematic grip of the play--inventive, lithe, somehow Shakespearean--are splendid. This Much Ado is a flawed gem. Certainly, regrettably, flawed; still, a gem.",83
Much Ado About Nothing,"Emma Thompson is normally a very reliable performer on screen, but Beatrice is not one of her successes.",83
Much Ado About Nothing,"Very accessible, jubilant Shakespeare with brief bawdiness.",83
Much Ado About Nothing,"A spirited, winningly acted rendition of one of the Bard's most popular comedies.",83
Much Ado About Nothing,"[Branagh] has found his way to the play's profound yet populist heart, rediscovering Shakespeare's vision of romantic fulfillment - celebration with an underlying tug of sadness - for an era that believes itself all too wise to the ways of love.",83
Robert A. Heinlein's The Puppet Masters,"While it’s far from Heinlein’s original flight of frightening fancy and its ending feels utterly bogus, ""The Puppet Masters"" remains a psychologically sound and physiologically gross dissection of the anatomy of occupation and the pathology of control.",84
Robert A. Heinlein's The Puppet Masters,...offers more paranoid fun that this film's reputation suggests...,84
Robert A. Heinlein's The Puppet Masters,Only the most undiscriminating monster-pic buff will come away satisfied.,84
Robert A. Heinlein's The Puppet Masters,"Despite accomplished special effects and a coolly intelligent script, this paranoid thriller never follows through on its eerie promise.",84
Robert A. Heinlein's The Puppet Masters,...generally as far-fetched and overwrought as its 1950s sci-fi brethren.,84
Robert A. Heinlein's The Puppet Masters,Lacked suspense.,84
Robert A. Heinlein's The Puppet Masters,There's no suspense (ETs rampage from the word go); no frissons (loud hailers telegraph the shocks); and it's insufficiently bright to be an hommage.,84
Robert A. Heinlein's The Puppet Masters,About as nerve-wracking as a warm bath.,84
Robert A. Heinlein's The Puppet Masters,"Not bad if you can get past the ""Invasion of the Plot Snatchers"" set-up.",84
Robert A. Heinlein's The Puppet Masters,"A choppy, unsuspenseful succession of chases, melodramatic showdowns and routine special effects.",84
"Ref, The","No matter how clever the script sometimes is, the laughs elicited by this movie are cheap, tinny sitcom laughs.",85
"Ref, The","Often cited by many as a favorite Christmas film. Why? Because it depicts family ties at its most honest and painful, which is closest to the truth of what and who we are, especially in the midst of fake cheer of the holidays. W/Pat&Ken At the Holidays!",85
"Ref, The",Demme and the screenwriters take care to fill out the scenario with vividly drawn characters such as Raymond J. Barry’s sardonic police chief and Robert Steinmiller Jr.’s Jesse.,85
"Ref, The",If you are in the mood for something different at Christmas than The Ref might be a fun choice for you.,85
"Ref, The","A film so bleak even Krampus had to watch ""Elf"" immediately afterwards to regain his Christmas spirit. Rude, loud, funny and (apart from the home invasion by a gun-toting jewellery thief bit), pretty realistic about families and the festive season.",85
"Ref, The","It's not just a Denis Leary vehicle. It's a real movie, with drama and grace and intelligence (and slapstick and drunk Santa gags and crude laughs).",85
"Ref, The",A genuinely hysterical anti-holiday comedy.,85
"Ref, The","It's miraculous casting, and the Australian Davis -- for my money the finest actress around, bar none -- is simply uncanny in her command of East Coast gentility combined with razor-sharp timing and comedic expression.",85
"Ref, The",The Ref benefits from having actor's actors like Davis and Spacey in the leads.,85
"Ref, The","This is a funny idea, but the movie is too thinly written to build any real credibility, and the cast rarely seems in tune with the vapid vulgarities that dominate the dialogue.",85
"Remains of the Day, The",This impeccable adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's Booker Prize-winning novel stars Anthony Hopkins as the emotionally repressed butler and Emma Thompson as the housekeeper he possibly loves.,86
"Remains of the Day, The",...a slow-moving yet increasingly absorbing drama...,86
"Remains of the Day, The","Anthony Hopkins is magnificent as Stevens, with his blinkered code of honour, and Emma Thompson his match as the housekeeper.",86
"Remains of the Day, The","Sublime filmmaking and performances turn Stevens’ every minute choice into a pillar of profound tragedy, giving us a maddeningly heartwrenching life lesson for the ages.",86
"Remains of the Day, The","The Remains of the Day is the perfect storm of writing, directing and acting.",86
"Remains of the Day, The",You can’t talk about great acting without thinking of The Remains of the Day...,86
"Remains of the Day, The",...governed by twin regrets.,86
"Remains of the Day, The","Like The Age of Innocence, here's another handsome period piece about a man who foolishly ignores the dictates of his heart.",86
"Remains of the Day, The",Beautiful to look at and deeply moving in many scenes.,86
"Remains of the Day, The","The movie looks splendid. Arcadian views and honeyed filters have been largely resisted. But the content, that is to say, the script, has problems.",86
Searching for Bobby Fischer,"The fields of math, music, chess, and acting all produce child prodigies. Luckily for us, lead child actor Max Pomeranc can check two prodigy boxes.",87
Searching for Bobby Fischer,"Newcomer Max Pomeranc is nothing short of brilliant as Josh, handing in one of the best performances by a child actor you could ever hope to see.",87
Searching for Bobby Fischer,Searching for Bobby Fischer is a wonderfully engaging film about a young chess prodigy.,87
Searching for Bobby Fischer,A rare family film that's not afraid to inject conflict and complexity into its images of domestic happiness.,87
Searching for Bobby Fischer,"Conrad Hall's Oscar-nominated photography is as impressive as the acting, with young Max Pomeranc, himself a top-ranking player, upstaging the likes of Joe Mantegna, Laurence Fishburne and Ben Kingsley.",87
Searching for Bobby Fischer,"It makes for a good old-fashioned inspirational story, absorbing and pointed.",87
Searching for Bobby Fischer,"Zaillian proves as much of a prodigy as his chess-playing subject, turning out a film that is a beautifully calibrated model of honestly sentimental filmmaking, made with delicacy, restraint and unmistakable emotional power.",87
Searching for Bobby Fischer,"The story he is telling--about parenting, teachers and students, and the nature of competition--is a rich one, and Zaillian tells it with warmth, humor and zest. The cast is first-rate.",87
Searching for Bobby Fischer,"Zaillian brings Searching for Bobby Fischer to a satisfying ending, but throughout the film he holds us with the finely balanced writing of his screenplay and with his ability to penetrate into the mysteries of chess.",87
Searching for Bobby Fischer,"A film full of love and passion for chess, especially when it gets compare with life in general. [Full review in Spanish]",87
Sleepless in Seattle,"Sleepless in Seattle is odd because there is no meet cute until the final scene. Somehow, Norah Ephron has created a world where it makes sense that two strangers are separated by 3,000 miles and still manage to fall in love.",88
Sleepless in Seattle,Sleepless in Seattle fully embraces romantic melodrama and Ephron cleverly exploits the insane chemistry that Hanks and Ryan share. Its greatness is undisputed and the list just wouldn’t be complete without it.,88
Sleepless in Seattle,"Sleepless in Seattle succeeds as a glorious three-way romantic comedy between men, women and children. It's a valiant valentine to the post-nuclear family.",88
Sleepless in Seattle,"Despite a madcap, slapstick type of comic conclusion, with no real hope of marital longevity, the film is terribly romantic.",88
Sleepless in Seattle,Sleepless in Seattle finds a way to put a fresh seasoning on top of the genre.,88
Sleepless in Seattle,"What are we teaching the other little sons of America, when they see so few movies as humane and woman-positive as Sleepless in Seattle, and so very many that portray women as evil incarnate?",88
Sleepless in Seattle,"The emotional weight of the drama rests on Hanks, and you appreciate how skilfully Ephron structures the film so that the two principals are bound by song and sentiment rather than physical proximity.",88
Sleepless in Seattle,But the movie's problems go deeper-than the dialogue: its whole premise is flawed.,88
Sleepless in Seattle,Sleepless In Seattle balances romance and realism by giving its central characters two different but equally pragmatic philosophies on love.,88
Sleepless in Seattle,"The rest of this romantic comedy about the strange power that pulls a man and woman together... only reinforces the notion that Ephron is a filmmaker whose time has come at last, after years as a novelist, screenwriter and feminist wit.",88
Blade Runner,"2049 is able to exist both as a masterful sequel and/or stand-alone film in the universe, which showcases Villeneuve’s massive skill as a storyteller and further validates him as one of the best visionaries of our generation.",89
Blade Runner,"If the original film’s warmth beneath the cold metropolitan’s structure came from Deckard’s love for Rachel, 2049 extends this ethos to a love and understanding of the self in the greater context of others.",89
Blade Runner,"Just as in the original, this film is as much about the texture of the world on screen as it is the story of the Replicants 30 years after Deckard first strolled the mean streets of L.A.",89
Blade Runner,"Much like its predecessor, 2049 is a methodically structured puzzle, solved through slow but persistent drips of revelation.",89
Blade Runner,"That Villeneuve achieves such a cerebral and even touching picture, while also accomplishing an uncommonly sublime production, marks Blade Runner 2049 as a landmark in the science-fiction genre.",89
Blade Runner,"It's immaculately constructed, full of true wonder, and keeps you under its spell all the way to the very end. In some ways, Blade Runner 2049 even surpasses the original.",89
Blade Runner,"Heady science-fiction fans, this episode is for you.",89
Blade Runner,A new chapter. A triumph. A cinematic miracle.,89
Blade Runner,"Unlike the original film, where the ""romance"" feels like a product of Deckard's dehumanized relationship with Replicants, the romance between Ryan Gosling's K and Ana de Armas' Joi, both machines, feels real and keeps the film intriguing.",89
Blade Runner,A skilfully made movie that works as a companion piece to Scott's film and as a detective mystery.,89
So I Married an Axe Murderer,"…what puts this film into the firmament is the evocation of Charlie’s Scottish family, red-haired, football loving abrasive characters who take the comedy beyond stereotypes to surreal levels… an under-appreciated comic gem...",90
So I Married an Axe Murderer,...a somewhat erratic yet mostly affable comedy...,90
So I Married an Axe Murderer,Comedian Mike Myers is best handled in incredibly small doses.,90
So I Married an Axe Murderer,"Fact is, So I Married An Axe Murderer fails on every level as a romantic comedy. It wants romance and a happy ending and a Woman-from-Hell.",90
So I Married an Axe Murderer,"You may feel trapped in a Saturday Night Live skit part of the time; the silly plot doesn't hang together well, and too many bawdy jokes misfire. Nevertheless, a sweetness pervades the film, which provides a generous view of human nature.",90
So I Married an Axe Murderer,The relationship between Travis and Myers is boring; too bad the whole film wasn't about the Scottish family. They deserve their own picture.,90
So I Married an Axe Murderer,"Best of all, are the characters who would be at home in one of Hitchcock's wackier outings: folks who are sympathetic or absurd, notorious or utterly psycho.",90
So I Married an Axe Murderer,Funny spoof on serial killers.,90
So I Married an Axe Murderer,"Quirky '90s comedy with mock horror action, sexuality.",90
So I Married an Axe Murderer,"Everyone quotes the Scottish-accented misanthropy. But at its heart, ""Axe"" is a sweet, funny romance between people trapped in patterns and freed by a positive paradigm shift. It's also the reason we never see Mike Myers' true face in films anymore.",90
"Nightmare Before Christmas, The","The Nightmare Before Christmas is unique and timeless, a magical adventure that’ll delight the senses and steal your heart.",91

"Nightmare Before Christmas, The","In the days of computer-animated films that occasionally appear no different than your average videogame, looking back, we must appreciate that Tim Burton and Henry Selick created something so wonderfully original.",91
"Nightmare Before Christmas, The","In 1993, The Nightmare Before Christmas premiered to moderate success but has since gone on to become a huge money making franchise for Disney.",91
"Nightmare Before Christmas, The",The playfully macabre humor of Tim Burton is deftly brought to life through the old-school magic of stop-motion animation by director Henry Selick...,91
"Nightmare Before Christmas, The","Producer Tim Burton's imaginatively dark, musical fantasy and original yet spooky stop-motion animated tale was directed by Burton's colleague at Disney Animation Henry Selick. It was also known as ""Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and served",91
"Nightmare Before Christmas, The","The movie is a perfect Halloween perennial, just short enough not to wear out its welcome and just long enough to brushstroke its Pagan vs. Christian subtext.",91
"Nightmare Before Christmas, The",The Nightmare Before Christmas is an analysis of why Christmas is so special and magic beyond just the wrapping on the outside.,91
"Nightmare Before Christmas, The",Films dont get more imaginative or original than this. The Nightmare Before Christmas is not just a good movieits everything we go to the movies for in the first place.,91
"Nightmare Before Christmas, The",This is a timeless classic that still entertains. I love this film.,91
True Romance,"While it might not have garnered the same critical praise as the Tarantino-helmed Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, True Romance has a charm of its own, which makes it impossible not to love.",92
True Romance,'...the perenially absorbing kinetic character collisions of True Romance are worth savouring...',92
True Romance,The varying sensibilities of Quentin Tarantino and Tony Scott come together to fashion one of the cornerstone films of the early 1990s.,92
True Romance,"wildly improbable and delightfully unpredictable, even when charging through some very familiar territory",92
True Romance,A bubble-gum movie packed with quirky characters and moving at the speed of a ricocheting pinball.,92
True Romance,"Scott had a knack for drawing out emotions from his actors, which in turn, creates strong performances and a movie in which audiences can become emotionally invested.",92
True Romance,"“True Romance” remains a sweet, if not strange, romantic action comedy from one of the best directors in modern cinema, written by one of cinema’s highest rated screenwriters, and featuring a cast that’s wall-to-wall incredible…",92
True Romance,"This is the realm of meta-cinema, where those who make movies, those who long to be in them and those who model their behaviour on them all come together to contrive between them a classic movie climax: a shoot-out...",92
True Romance,"Gritty, shocking, sexy, and violent, Tony Scott's film feels like the perfect union between frenetic action, darkly humorous mayhem, and biting dialogue.",92
True Romance,"Admittedly, the model is still weird, filled with unexpected twists and poetic outbursts, but in this case, the offspring is equally creative in its sense of verbal sequence. [Full Review in Spanish]",92
Welcome to the Dollhouse,"Todd Solondz's Welcome to the Dollhouse is one of the genre's most provocative, impactful, and poignant entries.",93
Welcome to the Dollhouse,... There are deep and uneasy truths about emergent sexuality and the Darwinian atavism of the playground.,93
Welcome to the Dollhouse,"Nobody comes out of this looking pretty, and dignity – a key word in the film – is always far removed from these characters’ Darwinian struggles to survive their day without being rejected, mistreated or much, much worse.",93
Welcome to the Dollhouse,Episode 36: Love in the Time of Monsters / Barbarella / Welcome to the Dollhouse / Johnny Guitar,93
Welcome to the Dollhouse,...a vision of middle-school awkwardness so cringe-worthy you'll be tempted to look away.,93
Welcome to the Dollhouse,"The beauty of Welcome to the Dollhouse is its pokerfaced objectivity, which neither condescends to its pubescent victim nor romantically inflates her plight.",93
Welcome to the Dollhouse,"Welcome to the Dollhouse marks a substantial (and obvious) improvement over filmmaker Todd Solondz's underwhelming debut, Fear Anxiety and Depression...",93
Welcome to the Dollhouse,A dark look at adolescence; not for kids.,93
Welcome to the Dollhouse,Welcome to the Dollhouse puts an ugly duckling through her paces.,93

Home Alone,"This film truly captures something enduring about what it's like to be a kid, and it continues to speak to that child in all of us.",94
Home Alone,"Without being the least bit schmaltzy or cloying, Home Alone manages to impart the holiday spirit. Its saving grace is an unexpected vein of irreverent humor that verges on the black.",94
Home Alone,This is going to be a big hit with the kids. Word will get out in the schoolyard that Home Alone is really funny. Just don’t let the kids near the iron after they’ve seen it.,94
Home Alone,Home Alone will send most moviegoers home with the warm glow of a story well told.,94
Home Alone,"Hughes wrote and produced Home Alone, leaving hapless Chris Columbus to direct this boorish, ham-fisted, sloppy screen comedy.",94
Home Alone,"Culkin is the perfect tufted tow-headed tyke; the human equivalent of the Roadrunner, his face twisting and eyes brightening with every revelation and idea. Pesci and Stern, accordingly, are cast as Wiley Coyotes.",94
Home Alone,"Home Alone is a cheerful, happy-minded comedy with clever casting and the kind of repetitious slapstick action to thrill the kids.",94
Home Alone,"Home Alone isn't high art, but it's a swell gift to movie-going families.",94
Home Alone,"Once Culkin is left to hos own devices, the film takes off. The last 45 minutes are achingly funny -- the perfect pre-Christmas present. Enjoy the laughs and don't leave anyone home alone. This is a picture the whole family can ejoy.",94
Home Alone,"For a dumb movie, Home Alone gets pretty smart pretty fast... just like little Kevin.",94
Aladdin,"Although some plot points are added or changed up, the core of the story remains the same, offering them to a new audience in a film that feels like a modern interpretation rather than a pointless fix-up.",95
Aladdin,"There’s a unique sense of visual speed Ritchie has a fantastic hold on, and while this is the least Guy Ritchie movie in his filmography, a lot of his signature beats are still alive and well, and they’re perfect for this particular remake.",95
Aladdin,"The original Aladdin had many flaws, but it was [...] full of heart. And, while Guy Ritchie's live action movie might be a better film in terms of special effects, dance routines and perhaps even structure, ""heart"" is exactly what it doesn't have.",95
Aladdin,"Guy Ritchie proves he’s a fantastic director, by delivering some beautiful one-take sequences, and exceptionally fun, well-choreographed musical numbers. Technically, the production and set design are astounding.",95
Aladdin,It plays like the most expensive Disney Channel Original Movie of all time; it’s not as cinematic as it is ready to stream.,95
Aladdin,"Overall, a decent attempt at remaking a treasured animated classic.",95
Aladdin,Aladdin works when it focuses on its characters. The world it builds is nice and lavish but without authentic depth. That combined with the lack of wonder and mystery keeps this from being as revolutionary as it would have liked to be.,95
Aladdin,…every element here is a pitiful downgrade on the original…,95
Aladdin,"While Smith and Massoud do display some buddy chemistry, it’s Naomi Scott’s fierce performance as Jasmine that’s the real showstopper.",95
Aladdin,The characters of Ritchie's film feel like they're trying to replicate better performances than they could ever hope to achieve.,95
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"James Cameron's critically and commercially acclaimed sci-fi blockbuster is still an almost-perfect sequel, 33 years after its release.",96
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,Terminator 2 was the perfect sequel as it gave bigger and better action sequences and chases and also changed things around to get the story going in a new direction,96
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"Like a relentless T-800 on a mission, this film continues to dominate as the greatest action movie ever made. Nearly 25 years later, it remains a high-octane adrenaline rush that’s guaranteed to have grown men weeping by the third act.",96
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"[Cameron's] showmanship is legendary, his capacity for orchestrating mayhem unparalleled. And Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a prime example.",96
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"There is not a single rift under its metal shell and, after so many years, it still retains the groundbreaking spirit with the science fiction journey of the machine that learns the value of human empathy. [Full review in Spanish]",96
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,One of the best franchise sequels ever made.,96
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"Bigger, bolder and slicker, T2 is one of the greatest sci-fi/action films of all time. [Full review in Spanish]",96

Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"Amazing things happen in Terminator 2, things you've never seen in movies -- things you didn't know the movies could do.",96
Dances with Wolves,"Forever known (and, in some circles, vilified) as The Movie That Beat GoodFellas For The Best Picture Oscar, Costner’s commercial and critical smash has seen its reputation diminish over the years -- an unfortunate development for a truly exemplary film.",97
Dances with Wolves,An exquisitely shot Western epic with majestic landscapes detailing the crimes against indigenous people and the final years of the American West.,97
Dances with Wolves,"Dances With Wolves is Costner's crossroads. Amazingly, he emerges from it a better actor and an extremely good director.",97
Dances with Wolves,"How much easier if the movie were crummy and could be dismissed. But, damn its smarmy soul, it's beautifully watchable, a return to the visual vernacular of the western epic and all its old-fashioned scenic values.",97
Dances with Wolves,"Magnificent. It's the only word to describe Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves. An epic in the grand tradition, it is a movie of breathtaking sweep and noble aims, and the story it tells is at once stirring and heartfelt.",97
Dances with Wolves,"This epic was made by a bland megalomaniac (The Indians should have named him ""Plays with Camera""). You look at that untroubled face and know he can make everything lightweight.",97
Dances with Wolves,"[Kevin Costner] is winning too much puff press for ""risking"" his stardom. Washed in John Barry's symphonic syrup (close your eyes and you see Out of Africa), the film basks in the comfy, 1-2-3 storytelling that once ruled Hollywood.",97
Dances with Wolves,"At times, Dances with Wolves comes dangerously close to becoming a stodgy historical drama. And yet, deftly inserted humor and strategically placed heart-tugs keep Dances with Wolves in step. It's a bravura piece of [David] Lean filmmaking.",97
Dances with Wolves,"Even with its flaws, Dances With Wolves is cause for celebration, a haunting elegy to the end of the Great Plains wilderness.",97
Dances with Wolves,It's difficult for any actor to direct himself effectively. It's amazing when someone does it in an epic that turns out as fine as this tale of the Old West.,97
"Silence of the Lambs, The","Its impact on movies is still being felt today, and it includes arguably the best performances of both Foster and Hopkins' careers.",98
"Silence of the Lambs, The",The crux of this excellent thriller is the battle of intellect and wills between them [Clarice Starling and Dr Hannibal Lecter].,98
"Silence of the Lambs, The","Suspenseful and shrewd, Hopkins’ Lecter is one of the most fascinating villains in film (despite less than 20 min of screen time). In spite of his contemptible reproach and steely demeanor, there’s just something about Lecter that makes us root for him.",98
"Silence of the Lambs, The","Most books, plays or films never give us even this much. Yet The Silence of the Lambs gives us so much that it's a shame the film doesn't find ways to deepen its concentration on the colossal aberrance of the minds of its complementary terrors.",98
"Silence of the Lambs, The",The transformation between the two protagonists is truly outstanding. [Full review in Spanish],98
"Silence of the Lambs, The",The film flows from beginning to end without a single detour on its fatalist course. [Full review in Spanish],98
"Silence of the Lambs, The",A failure that is a function of its success.,98
"Silence of the Lambs, The","An exceptional thriller; a film that puts us in the shoes —and in the eyes— of its protagonist as very few other productions have managed to do, introducing us to a world of killers and cannibals and the FBI agents who chase them. Full review in Spanish.",98
"Silence of the Lambs, The",Most viewers will be rooting for Foster's Starling all the way up to the expertly directed denouement -- a darkly whimsical ending that would have been utterly unacceptable in the old days of the Production Code.,98
"Silence of the Lambs, The","It is a freak occurrence of the right director, the right script, and the right cast making something that transcends genre and reshapes popular culture.",98
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"If I were asked to list the most important movie activity of 1937 ten years from now, I should have only one item to report: Walter Disney made a full length picture. And this one event may save the industry as it is now organized.",99
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,...a bonafide classic...,99
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"While Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs might be simple, it is still an effective feature. The characters are all incredibly likable and the technical backbone of the film is flawless.",99
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,To say of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs that it is among the genuine artistic achievements of this country takes no great daring.,99
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,Kids will like the film most because of the Dwarfs' hilarious antics. Grown-ups because they will think they're kids again.,99
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,There are many charming moments. And there are many rhythmic scenes. The mining and marching scenes wherein the dwarfs sing a “hai ho” song are a masterpiece of rhythm. And so are the dancing scenes staged by Snow White and the dwarfs.,99
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"""Masterpiece"" and all the other enthusiastic words that are to be lavished upon [Snow White] seem too heavy a burden to bear for anything spun with such gracious, heart-warming charm, woven from the stuff of dreams.",99
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"It was the dearest picture I have ever seen. The characters were so sweet that I just wanted to hug them... The Prince Charming was very charming (I wish I could find a living one, just like him) and Snow White was lovely.",99
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,The dwarfs are a circus. The prince is handsome. Snow White is a maid of charm appeal and initiative. And Stepmother! Shudder shudder! And laugh till your sides ache!,99
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"Much has been said and written about some of the more frightening sequences and their probable effect on young children. I can't pose any great knowledge of child psychology, but I know I'd hate to see them miss Snow White.",99
Fargo,"Immaculately plotted, beautifully written and superbly shot by British cinematography Roger Deakins, a longtime Coen collaborator, Fargo is a treasure.",100
Fargo,Fargo begins with a thunderous orchestral score by Carter Burwell as it beckons the audience towards the tragic events that are about to unfold.,100
Fargo,"Fargo is a masterwork, one of the best films we’ve ever gotten to dissect the uneasy balance behind good and evil in a world where everyone might come across as nice.",100
Fargo,The Coen brothers get back to basics with Fargo by going back to their home state of Minnesota for one of the best films in their career.,100
Fargo,"Many cinephiles believe that Fargo is the Coen brothers’ magnum opus, and perhaps they are right, as the film has all the hallmarks of a masterstroke...",100
Fargo,A black-comedy slam-dunk.,100
Fargo,The spirit of comedy counterbalances the violence of the gangster film and trumps it hands down. Kind ordinariness and the wordy story clash victoriously with the irony of fate that lies in wait for enterprising hearts.,100
Fargo,"Though Miller's Crossing may be the one Coen movie as poetic as it is absurd, Fargo is the brothers' smartest film and a matter-of-fact masterpiece.",100
Fargo,The performances by McDormand (bringing a great screen character to life) and Macy are superb.,100
Fargo,"The North Dakota setting is icily evocative, the supporting characters perfectly pitched (remember Marge's old flame Mike Yanagita?), while the air of sadness that blankets the film like snow adds genuine profundity.",100
Heavy Metal,"Heavy Metal is a mind boggling, mind blowing animation extravaganza.",101
Heavy Metal,A mixed bag of a movie.,101
Heavy Metal,"A cult film receives a sterling AV transfer from Sony, while its miscalculation of a sequel makes its high-def debut on home video.",101
Heavy Metal,Heavy Metal didnt win any awards and the movie certainly isnt for everyone (neither is Heavy Metal 2000) but it has a certain charm that allows it to have a cult-like following.,101
Heavy Metal,"It's a movie full of the things teenaged boys love, including aliens, robots, and shapely naked ladies. (40th anniversary)",101
Heavy Metal,The film is a laudable attempt to present the world of cartoon movies to another type of audience. [Full Review in Spanish],101
Heavy Metal,"Heavy Metal proposes a narrative that is not always intelligible, where the monotony conceals the imagination of the filmmakers. [Full Review in Spanish]",101
Heavy Metal,It's definitely watchable for fans that appreciate the exploitative pulp nature of the magazine set to excellent rock music.,101
Heavy Metal,"Exemplifies the notion that the euphemism ""adult material"" almost exclusively denotes content which is chiefly of appeal to people other than adults.",101
Heavy Metal,"In 1981, this may have been state-of-the-art animation, but now it looks rudimentary, clunky, and flat. The writing, likewise, is flat.",101
"Aristocats, The","While the animation is cute and the film creates an incredibly likable main cast of characters each with their own unique personality and presence, the narrative is incredibly basic and lacks any deeper dimension when it comes to purpose or poignance.",102
"Aristocats, The",The animation is masterful and the overall design is appealing.,102
"Aristocats, The","I kind of feel the same way about the Aristocats as I felt about Fun, Fancy and Free. Both felt very lazy and derivative of better films.",102
"Aristocats, The","The Aristocats is in there with the good ones. It is light and pleasant and funny, the characterization is strong, and the voices of Phil Harris and Eva Gabor are charming in their absolute rightness.",102
"Aristocats, The","The carefully painted Paris setting has the watery air of Ardizzone, while light and colour are used beautifully throughout.",102
"Aristocats, The","Before the disastrous Aughts, was there a worse decade for Disney animated features than the 1970s?",102
"Aristocats, The","A cute, feline version of ""Lady and the Tramp"" that should enthrall families . . . and, of course, cat lovers.",102
"Aristocats, The",Jazz and hijinks make this Disney cat tale meow.,102
"Aristocats, The","Insofar as the film has any real ambition driving it, that ambition seems to be that the Disney brand name must be kept alive until somebody could figure out what to do with it.",102
"Aristocats, The","An enjoyable mix of fine animation, catchy songs, and outstanding voice characterizations.",102
All Dogs Go to Heaven 2,Showily bizarre.,103
All Dogs Go to Heaven 2,This dark coming-of-age story is a unique romp.,103
Theodore Rex,"So what of this shame of New Line, the film that seemed like a no-win disaster to the star of Eddie and Made in America? It's pretty much exactly that bad, in fact",104
Sgt. Bilko,Flat and unappealing.,105
Sgt. Bilko,"The new bunch are good actors, but without that vital touch of insanity. The laughs are sparse and often telegraphed.",105
Sgt. Bilko,"Martin's Bilko is a career grifter who comes out on top every time. He's a Bilko for the nasty '90s, oily and smug.",105
Sgt. Bilko,"Though Martin and a solid supporting cast produce a few scattered moments of near-hilarity, for the most part the terrain here is as flat as it gets.",105
Sgt. Bilko,"Aside from the sheer insanity of trying to leap into the shoes of the irreplaceable Phil Silvers, surely Martin should have recognized that the film had no script, no gags and no discernible point.",105
Sgt. Bilko,[A] celebration of high jinks.,105
Sgt. Bilko,"We've seen it before, almost frame for frame, in every other service comedy, especially ""Stripes.""",105
Sgt. Bilko,"This is shoddy hackwork, replaying classic scenarios (the honest new recruit, audits by Pentagon bigwigs and manoeuvres in Nevada) with such disregard for narrative structure the reels might be in the wrong order.",105
Sgt. Bilko,A big disappointment.,105
Sgt. Bilko,"The film is full of gratifying gags like these, but it also has to strain for newly enlarged scope.",105
Diabolique,"A true classic in the suspenseful thriller/horror genre, with a twist “to die for”.",106
Diabolique,Diabolique is a work of art... the personification of anxiety.,106
Diabolique,"The story is simple, but executed perfectly...",106
Diabolique,"What is certain is that Clouzot has achieved 100 percent of his goal and that the viewer cannot help but experience all the emotions the director has prepared for him, as if along a scenic highway.",106
Diabolique,"If somebody insists, against all warnings, on telling you how Diabolique comes out, kill him in cold blood. There isn't a jury in the land that would convict you.",106
Diabolique,"Hitchcock, even in his earlier and rougher days, never turned out a movie of such diabolical proportions.",106
Diabolique,"It's a super suspense yarn knitted together with a deft Gallic touch. Madame DuFarge couldn't do better, and a splendid, very splendid cast, sees that no dramatic stitches are dropped.",106
Diabolique,"Diabolique is a devilishly good movie, real cool for hot weather.",106
Diabolique,"This is a superbly chilling slice of life, one indeed to challenge the best of Alfred Hitchcock. It is a tale of murder which turns the innately innocent setting of a boarding school into a hair-raising labyrinth of passion.",106
Diabolique,"Don't sell Diabolique short, because it has the most shocking sequences you've ever seen on the screen.",106
Moll Flanders,Moll Flanders is an admirable effort but still a bit difficult to sit through.,107
Moll Flanders,"The movie takes Moll's name, but mollifies her spirit.",107
Moll Flanders,"The plot hinges on rather too much coincidence, and some lines of the British-accented dialogue garble on the soundtrack, but the film offers charming performances and a vivid sense of time, place and human dignity.",107
Moll Flanders,"It takes an exceptionally talentless screenwriter-director to make such a foul, boring, worthless descreation of DeFoe's witty, insightful and entertaining novel, and Densham is that incompetent.",107
Moll Flanders,"Salutes the hard-won bounties of hope, enduring friendship, and the quality of mercy.",107
Moll Flanders,"For a story about a London harlot's trials and tribulations, this is one unsexy, drawn-out dirge with only a few smirking moments as relief.",107
Moll Flanders,More bore-dy than bawdy.,107
Moll Flanders,"The film's melodramatic ending sorts everything out in the approved style of the genre, but the movie is really better than that, a portrait of a woman who endures, thinks, and survives.",107
Moll Flanders,Moll Flanders is an admirable effort but still a bit difficult to sit through.,107
Moll Flanders,"The movie takes Moll's name, but mollifies her spirit.",107
Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy,"I think it’s supposed to be a comedy. Perhaps because no one in the cast adjusted his performance style to the big screen, I may have thought about laughing three times over the 90-some minutes.",108
Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy,"Unfortunately, what works for the Kids on TV doesn't work as well in their first feature film.",108
Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy,"Despite a subject matter that deals with misery, the picture is very funny, with sharp visual style to support this often wild journey into the business of being unhappy.",108
Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy,"Yet despite its unevenness, Brain Candy is a very funny movie whose principal comedic concerns are as viable today as they were a quarter-century ago.",108
Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy,"it's thoroughly quotable, infinitely watchable and so rich with detail that you'll be laughing at something new every time you watch it.",108

Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy,You'll be laughing through your disapproval.,108
Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy,"There are some very funny bits, but they're interspersed with long stretches of exposition that drag the whole thing down, down, down.",108
Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy,The ensemble is assured and adroitly gets the gags across without telegraphing punch lines.,108
Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy,"A twisted comedy for twisted times, this movie made me happy. Go figure.",108

Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie,"There are still enough bad makeup jobs, pretentious lines, and coy sexual situations to give the chattering puppets plenty of fodder.",109
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie,"If you're in the mood for some knuckleheaded comedy at the expense of -- in mad scientist Dr. Forrester's words -- ""a stinky cinematic suppository called This Island Earth,"" then get thee to some place playing MST3K.",109
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie,It's a fun enough way to pass the time. And fans of the TV version of MST3K certainly won't be disappointed. But it would be just as much -- if not more -- fun watching it in your own living room with a bunch of rowdy pals.,109
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie,"Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie is about a third as funny as it thinks it is. Still, that's pretty funny and about twice as funny as most American comedies these days.",109
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie,"[MSTies] can rest assured that the movie is about as funny as a typical episode of the show that is, pretty darn funny in a sly and satirical sort of way. For others, the movie can serve as a good introduction to the whole MST3K phenomenon.",109
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie,"The show provides a prodigious number of giggles, and it's so short (well under 90 minutes) that you'll have plenty of time to rent the original This Island Earth and test out wisecracks of your own.",109
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie,"The film is a vindication of bad taste, and of the principle that mocking well is the best revenge.",109

"Truth About Cats & Dogs, The",Why quibble? You'll still go home purring and wagging your tail.,111
"Truth About Cats & Dogs, The","Though the basic brains-versus-beauty tension suggests a female variation on The Nutty Professor, this is a softer version of the dilemma than Jerry Lewis offers-easier to take and easier to forget.",111
"Truth About Cats & Dogs, The",In time... this tale of a terrible quandary becomes as witty and engaging as the confident yet oddly insecure Abby.,111
"Truth About Cats & Dogs, The","It's a charming little romantic comedy that never tries to outweigh its own charm. Best of all, it never forgets how much that charm is dependent on the woman in its center.",111
"Truth About Cats & Dogs, The",Affable yet relatively unmemorable...,111
"Truth About Cats & Dogs, The","You feel that Lehmann has too much affection for the people on screen to let them seem like dupes. Then again, that's part of the movie's charm.",111
"Truth About Cats & Dogs, The","Funny and intelligent, despite some flaws.",111
"Truth About Cats & Dogs, The","What really makes ""The Truth About Cats & Dogs"" special in places... is Garofalo's dry, self-effacing wit and Thurman's ditzy, old-style Hollywood glamour.",111

"Rock, The",Strapped with an improbable and occasionally insulting premise (although it is VERY loosely based on the true story of Setara Hussainzada) and a third act twist into misplaced social commentary Murray's charm falls flat.,117
"Rock, The","If you want to watch Bill Murray romp around a foreign land, re-watch Lost in Translation.",117
"Rock, The",The best one can say of Rock the Kasbah is that its culturally insensitive moments feel ill-judged rather than malicious. It's not trying to punch down - it's just not funny.,117
"Rock, The","It's loaded with talent in front of and behind the camera that never quite clicks. It's a film that struggles in tone, largely because its lead actor, Bill Murray, comes off feeling as though he were wedged into the project.",117

Twister,"The sum of its great and hokey parts is very entertaining to watch, and even its flaws are enjoyable because nothing about the film feels cynical or pandering.",118
Twister,"Think of Twister as the multiplex version of a porn flick: You have to sit through stretches of uneven acting, stale plotting, and dumb dialogue to get to the good stuff.",118
Twister,"It lacks any interesting characters or drama. Like an amusement park ride, its ups and downs ultimately peter out, leaving the viewer with little more than a momentary buzz or two to remember.",118

Twister,"Jan de Bont's 1996 action classic is an absurd snapshot of Hollywood's delirious past, and it's still just as fun nearly three decades later.",118

"Cable Guy, The","This is a darker film for Carrey, but he's still Jim Carrey. His shenanigans keep even the blackest moments goofy.",122

Lone Star,John Sayles’s Lone Star is among the most literary films ever made.,124

Lone Star,"The geographic space of Lone Star has a singular historical, psychological and emotional resonance within the intimate life of those who inhabit it. [Full review in Spanish]",124
Lone Star,"John Sayles' Lone Star contains so many riches, it humbles ordinary movies. And yet they aren't thrown before us, to dazzle and impress: It is only later, thinking about the film, that we appreciate the full reach of its material.",124
Lone Star,"Lone Star offers all the satisfaction of a deftly structured, deeply intelligent novel or a luminous canvas for the imagination -- not to mention a mirror for the subjective processes of memory and desire.",124

Supercop,Supercop could become GoldenEye. What’s most depressing is that audiences might not mind.,128
Supercop,"As with nearly all of Chan's films, this one boasts a comic quirk to the adventure - even something of a Chaplin-esque quality to the slapstick havoc.",128

Bound,A perfect movie.,129
Bound,"Easily one of the sexiest films ever made, Bound has undergone a significant reappraisal from queers in the wake of the Wachowski sisters coming out. This neo-noir is stylish, impeccably produced, and features all-time performances from Tilly & Gershon",129
Bound,"Like so many other rob-the-mob movies, the plan seems pretty far-fetched, and the ending isn’t much of a surprise. But if you like your films sprinkled liberally with sex, violence and humor, then you’re bound to like ""Bound.""",129

Die Hard,"To say Die Hard still holds up is an understatement: charismatic protagonist and antagonist, great action set pieces, well paced and a top class finale. It’s no wonder so many other films and TV series continue to “do a Die Hard”, it’s still hard to top.",144
Die Hard,"Top to bottom, it is just endlessly entertaining and well-crafted with outstanding work from all involved. No matter how much action movies have continued to grow, this will always be the cinematic elder statesman that can scrap with the best of them.",144
Die Hard,"That’s right, I’m saying it, loudly and proudly, since John McTiernan’s 1988 action classic isn’t just set at Christmastime—it embodies the very spirit of the holiday.",144
Die Hard,"The gold standard for action filmmaking; what action movie tropes Die Hard doesn't follow, it reinvents or altogether originates, and all of them have yet to be bettered.",144
Die Hard,Give Die Hard a fresh spin this year; it's the most joyous Christmas film of all!,144
Die Hard,I really appreciated the interpersonal relationship between him and his wife. It wasn't slow but it was taking its time.,144

"Lawnmower Man, The","It’s cheesy and dripping in 90s silliness, but this VR thriller offers an unnerving – if not absurd – cyberthriller.",145
"Lawnmower Man, The","…even if the story is rote, this wacky directors cut is probably the best way to appreciate the skewed, past-tense vision of our future that we get a glimpse of here…",145
"Lawnmower Man, The",It's harder than ever to take Jeff Fahey's performance seriously since it's as broad as Ben Stiller's Tugg Speedman character playing Simple Jack in Tropic Thunder.,145
"Lawnmower Man, The","The Lawnmower Man is an ambitious not-quite failure that almost dared King to sue from moment one, but is still worth a watch if you love aged computer graphics and shlocky cheese.",145
"Lawnmower Man, The","There are plenty of eye-rolling moments in this film, and not just from the dated effects.",145
"Lawnmower Man, The",It's an intriguing premise that's employed to perpetually erratic effect by director Brett Leonard...,145
"Lawnmower Man, The",Gratuitously offensive.,145
"Lawnmower Man, The",Its greatest assets are its dazzling video game special effects.,145
"Lawnmower Man, The","Nowadays, The Lawnmower Man's cyberspace looks like a budget PlayStation 2 title.",145
Unhook the Stars,"...a quiet, gentle drama that benefits from its raft of above-average performances...",146
Unhook the Stars,"Nick Cassavetes' first feature celebrates the acting grandeur of his mom Gena Rowlands, casting her in the lead role as a older woman who would rather stick to her independent lifestyle than be dependent on her kids; I wish the script were better.",146
Unhook the Stars,"A sensitive, honest, touching study of the seemingly limited options faced by a woman whose age belies her energy, enthusiasm and ability to enjoy herself whenever the opportunity presents itself.",146
Unhook the Stars,Cassavetes' film reveals that he has a sharp eye for human nature.,146
Unhook the Stars,a performance-driven picture--and what driving.,146

Unhook the Stars,Charts the transformation of a middle-class suburban widow.,146
Unhook the Stars,A tender and perceptive psychological portrait ...,146
Unhook the Stars,The movie is likable and sympathetic but probably too muted to compel much damn-the -torpedoing to the multiplex.,146
Unhook the Stars,"Rowlands infuses Mildred's interior life with a complexity that isn't always apparent from her somewhat chilly, bland exterior.",146
"Long Kiss Goodnight, The","Just a year after Davis teamed up with director, and then husband, Renny Harlin on the box office flop Cutthroat Island, the two returned with another overegged and overlong action thriller.",147
"Long Kiss Goodnight, The",...a decent-enough actioner trapped within the confines of a wildly overlong misfire.,147
"Long Kiss Goodnight, The",This movie is so bad that it needs to be seen to be fathomed.,147
"Long Kiss Goodnight, The","You wont be disappointed with cursing, extraordinarily skilled and smart Charly and warm, polite Samantha who, oftentimes, throws a knife around because ""chefs do that"".",147

"Long Kiss Goodnight, The","Despite its often basic action structure, there is enough substance in the script to intrigue those viewers who normally look down on movies loaded-up with blasts, blows and blood.",147
"Long Kiss Goodnight, The","The odd couple pairing of Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson is one of the film's best assets, as the duo display terrific comedic chemistry.",147
"Long Kiss Goodnight, The","For once, Shane Black's penchant for Christmas isn't merely window-dressing. He understands the holiday's sometimes wearying grenade-shrapnel shell-shock - and how claustrophobically cloistering with loved ones often can only expand the blast radius.",147
"Long Kiss Goodnight, The","The surprise and also the disappointment of The Long Kiss Goodnight is much simpler, and less politically inflected: it's badly made, or too close to badly made.",147
"Long Kiss Goodnight, The","Frankly, if I had to see either Harlin-Davis movie again, I'd opt for the klutzy unpleasantness of Cutthroat Island over the efficient if equally stupid unpleasantness of this 1996 release.",147
"Ghost and the Darkness, The","The film has a core competency - being a meat-and-potatoes thriller about killer lions - and as such, it's kind of frustrating how much time it spends not doing that.",148

"Ghost and the Darkness, The",Lions terrorize bridge-building crew; gore and violence.,148
"Ghost and the Darkness, The","Hopkins' direction is competent, and Goldman's screenplay merely serves its purpose.",148
"Ghost and the Darkness, The",A scenery-chewing Michael Douglas is the highlight of this passable landlocked variation of Jaws.,148

"Ghost and the Darkness, The","It sounds like it might be a good movie, but it ain't.",148
Jude,"Far from another cuted-up, waistcoat- &-bustle Emma Thompson weekend getaway, Jude is stark, gnarly, and breathtaking.",149
Jude,"What Jude misses by being so darned pretty is any sense of the magnitude of the harshness of Victorian society towards anyone, particularly women, whose life didn’t conform to the expected pieties.",149
Jude,"Beautifully shot adaptation of the Thomas Hardy novel 'Jude The Obscure' -- a bit workmanlike, but solid, well-acted and artfully rendered. (Scorpion Releasing blu-ray).",149
Jude,"Winslet is captivating and heartbreaking in a performance that should have gotten Oscar attention, and Eccleston matches her in intensity and passion. Both mine the subtleties and nuances of these rich, difficult characters.",149
Jude,Jude is masterfully rendered.,149
Jude,"The film has its period down cold, but what makes it special is its nerve, about which the best you can say is that it matches Hardy's own.",149
Jude,"It's good quality stuff, but sublimely miserable.",149
Jude,"It's worth seeing Jude, a stark adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure, just for the extraordinary performance of Christopher Eccleston as Jude Fawley.",149
Jude,"Young English actress Kate Winslet adds luster and energy to Jude, a bold and generally successful attempt to adapt Thomas Hardy's final novel, Jude the Obscure, to the bigscreen.",149
Jude,"Without the benefit of Hardy's prose, the point of the movie is lost in the grim, grayish ether.",149
Swingers,...a low-key premise that’s employed to engaging and frequently hilarious effect...,150
Swingers,"Here is pure exuberance, without all that messy nostalgic yearning. Here is a movie unafraid to come right out and showcase the sheer idiot joy involved in being a boy among boys.",150
Swingers,"Wholly admiring bygone eras, this little indie darling bucked the mainstream and dazzled those looking for something dreamy, yet still honest, for its coarse present day.",150
Swingers,"""Swingers"" doesn't really add up to much -- except a good time. But it's smart, funny and cute. With all that going for you, who needs to be money?",150
Swingers,"What it lacks as a cutting character drama, it makes up for in easily quaffable lifestyle porn, though it's up for debate whether one of those things is equal to the other.",150
Swingers,"It's not the most creative of plots, but it captures a generation and the down-on-your-luck-in-so-many-ways motif effectively: it's like comfort food, with more heart than Liman usually provides.",150
Swingers,"Four guys hang out, kid one another, get into scuffles and flash their gonadal searchlight for available women. Yikes, haven't there been enough variations on the multiple-buddy movie? Actually, no.",150

Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"What else to say? My amazement is generational, but finding out more about the film makes it even better. Let's just say this may be the greatest film ever made to promote a corporate candy bar, which ultimately melted. Gene Wilder, Best. Wonka. Ever.",151
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"In 2023, the film seems dated, so it's best for younger children or adults who want whimsical nostalgia. Gene Wilder makes the mold for a Wonka that is more approachable than Johnny Depp's and allows for the possibility of Timothée Chalamet's.",151
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"A timeless classic with an all-time performance from Gene Wilder. This film is a marvel: weird, occasionally terrifying and visually wonderful. That chocolate lake looks disgusting, though.",151
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"The movie has some things to recommend it -- the atmosphere, the imagination, the story's overall intelligence -- but it's rather harsh and moralistic.",151
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"Exuberant, macabre and unpredictable...",151
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"Every time you watch it you're newly impressed by its heartfelt story line, unfussy direction, wit and humor (with Gene Wilder giving a performance for the ages). Warner 4K HD blu-ray.",151

Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,Where it reigns supreme is in its casting of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka.,151
Sleeper,"Though well acted and never uninteresting, Light Sleeper is far less intense than most of Schrader's work and further diluted by an unrealistic ending.",152
Sleeper,"From that opening use of “World on Fire”, Been’s vocals and melancholic, somber tones feel as rooted in the essence of Light Sleeper as Dafoe’s razor-sharp bone structure, or those heaps of trash bags lining the sidewalks.",152
Sleeper,...an erratic yet predominantly satisfying effort from Schrader.,152
Sleeper,American filmmakers have a weakness for presenting a shoot-out as either the precursor of redemption or redemptive in itself; this film falls into the latter group.,152
Sleeper,The cast is skilfully alert... and Schrader's vision is unencumbered either by sentiment or cynicism.,152
Sleeper,It's good Schrader -- a quiet and gentle portrait of moral squalor among very fashion-conscious people who wear silk scarves and green suede jackets and lunch at Cote Basque.,152
Sleeper,"A telling, atmospheric portrayal of the life of New York in the hours when most people are sleeping soundly in their cozy beds, not cruising aimlessly through the darkness.",152
Sleeper,The plot and characterization came across as an adolescent fantasy which had entirely missed its mark.,152
Sleeper,A resonant thriller.,152
Sleeper,The movie is smart and sassy and alluring. It's like a gifted impressionist updating his material with wit and brio and respect.,152
"Fish Called Wanda, A","Best of all, A Fish Called Wanda showed that Cleese – closer to 50 than his character’s age of 40 – could tackle the intricacies of romance.",153
"Fish Called Wanda, A",... one of the funniest comedies of the eighties.,153
"Fish Called Wanda, A","The bright characterizations, vivid performances, and unexpectedly uproarious set-pieces have lost little of their luster over the ensuing decades.",153
"Fish Called Wanda, A",It's almost as if each antihero is competing to be the most despicable of the lot.,153
"Fish Called Wanda, A","If anything, what Cleese and director Charles Crichton celebrate with A Fish Called Wanda is the art of the ensemble. Getting the pieces together is difficult, but when it works, it's a masterpiece.",153
"Fish Called Wanda, A",There are certainly plenty of elements within A Fish Called Wanda that work exceedingly well...,153
"Fish Called Wanda, A","A nutty caper film that is sometimes riotous, sometimes romantic, and sometimes merely confused.",153
"Fish Called Wanda, A","To those who appreciate Ealing comedy (which is to say all right-thinking people), watching the film is like chancing on a Hogarth sketch in grandmother's attic, clearly and unmistakably signed by the Master.",153
"Fish Called Wanda, A","In the Monty Python tradition, the script is an assembly of skitlike situations cobbled into a flimsy story. The humor is cruel and at times wildly funny.",153
"Fish Called Wanda, A","The antics alone are fun to watch, but the dialogue is priceless, and there's never been such a hilarious blend of American and British humor.",153
Monty Python's Life of Brian,"It’s still extremely funny, as quotable now as it ever was, and as searingly, eye-openingly intelligent.",154
Monty Python's Life of Brian,"A considerably effective parody, particularly as it sends up the arbitrary interpretation of signs and symbols, the follies of blind faith, and the atrocities conducted in the name of religion.",154
Monty Python's Life of Brian,"This inspired send-up of religious epics was surrounded by controversy on its release, but it is, nevertheless, the Monty Python team's most assured and satisfying cinematic work.",154
Monty Python's Life of Brian,"With forgiveness from all condemnations, I laughed from start to finish with Life of Brian. [Full review in Spanish]",154

Monty Python's Life of Brian,All the Pythons are at the top of their game here. The jokes are joyously silly and the writing razor sharp.,154
Monty Python's Life of Brian,"Given all the fuss and controversy, not to mention its belated status as a classic, I dearly wish it were funnier. Much too much of it, though, depends on silly voices...",154
Monty Python's Life of Brian,"The plot treads a narrow, semi-blasphemous path through ancient times.",154
Monty Python's Life of Brian,"While the movie doesn't reinvent the wheel, it is professionally impeccable. [Full Review in Spanish]",154
Monty Python's Life of Brian,Life of Brian is undoubtedly the greatest religious satire of all-time. Comedic gold.,154
Dirty Dancing,“Dirty Dancing” is one of the only films from this era that depicts a girl’s embracing her sexual desire and agency—without regret.,155
Dirty Dancing,The use of locations is another virtue that Dirty Dancing has on its side as you do come to feel at home in the resort and regret the fact that establishments like this disappeared.,155
Dirty Dancing,"The film is still an easy, classic watch that still tugs at the emotions at the end. Nobody puts Baby in the corner, indeed.",155
Dirty Dancing,The recent US Supreme Court developments send us back to the dark side of 1987s Dirty Dancing and make it relevant again in 2022. Jennifer Grey's performance is what truly anchors this classic.,155
Dirty Dancing,"Dirty Dancing features a timeless romance and a lead couple with compelling chemistry, plus all those memorable dance scenes, but it endures because it is unabashedly pro-sex.",155
Dirty Dancing,"Swayze and Grey were inspired casting choices, each fitting into their respective roles like a glove.",155
Dirty Dancing,The scorching chemistry between Swayze and Grey is enough to crush any petty plot concerns or questions about how they could be dancing to instruments that haven’t been invented yet.,155
Dirty Dancing,"Johnny Castle might be featured as the romantic hero of 'Dirty Dancing'. But Baby’s father Dr. Houseman is the actual hero of the story, and his behavior is something in the movie that remains ahead of its time.",155
Dirty Dancing,Say what you will about its rough-around-the-edges qualities - this movie is a classic that endures because it addresses a lot of important issues.,155
Dirty Dancing,"Though the premise is simple and the bulk of the film is comprised of montages, there's an undeniable effort put into the abundance of romantic scenarios.",155
Reservoir Dogs,"A fond genre move that's forever chortling up its sleeve at the puerile idiocy of the genre, a heist caper without a heist, an action movie that's hopelessly in love with talk and a poem to the sexiness of storytelling.",156
Reservoir Dogs,"Reservoir Dogs is an impressive debut that reflects Tarantino's unique, postmodern style and points towards things to come.",156
Reservoir Dogs,"Precisely plotted and engagingly juggled into a rich swirl of flashbacks that wind through the current crisis, this is the work of a director who loves movies and a storyteller engaged with the art of telling stories.",156
Reservoir Dogs,The film possesses a stomach-churning urgency following a deceptively languid opening...,156
Reservoir Dogs,"I still think this lean, merciless and hellishly funny debut might be the best thing he ever made...",156
Reservoir Dogs,"An indie cult classic from the 90s, here's a film that's oozed cool all the way through thanks to the combo of a fiery set of character actors led by the intense Harvey Keitel, and its sharp ear for dialogue filled with profanity and pop culture.",156
Reservoir Dogs,"While it borrows generously from a number of other films, the way Tarantino structures his crime drama is a breath of fresh air.",156
Reservoir Dogs,"... if one considers this initial film as it is, a stamp made from a storyteller just getting started, ""Reservoir Dogs"" maintains its strength and vitality. All of which are improved by the UHD experience.",156
Reservoir Dogs,"Quentin Tarantino hit a home run with his feature debut, Reservoir Dogs, and cinema would never be the same.",156
Reservoir Dogs,"The story is as phony as the names the robbers take - Mr. White, Mr. Blue, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown - and it's also a hymn to violence, blood and sadism that reaches repulsive levels.",156
Platoon,One of the most visceral and authentic war films ever made.,157
Platoon,Platoon may not be the best Vietnam war film ever made -- I still prefer both Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket by a healthy margin -- but I wouldn't care to argue with any veteran who states that it's the most honest depiction of that insane skirmish.,157
Platoon,"In terms of the day-to-day madness of combat, Stone’s vision is horrifyingly realistic, the reportage of someone who was there.",157
Platoon,This is a great American movie -- easily the most powerful film of the year.,157
Platoon,"I didn't take a single note during the screening of Platoon: It's that engrossing, that overwhelming.",157
Platoon,"It is a terrifying movie, one that will shatter illusions. But that is the heart of Stone's message.",157
Platoon,"It's a powerful, painful, must-see film -- an impassioned and riveting dispatch from the front that's at once a battle cry and a lamentation.",157
Platoon,"There's no self-conscious artistry here, no metaphorical trips up a river into a thickening jungle. Platoon is a clean, direct narrative that may not go to the heart of darkness but does get to the heart of the matter.",157
Platoon,"Exactly as the war it chronicles was conceptually flawed by the chronic problem of fighting 1967's battles by 1944's tactics, so is Platoon flawed by its decision to make 1987's movie by 1957's structure.",157
Platoon,"Extravagantly well acted and passionately directed, it is not a pretty picture. But it may well prove a healing one for Americans who were there or who are beginning to understand and accept the particular heroics of the 27 million Vietnam veterans.",157

Weekend at Bernie's,"Bernie's is good old, knock-down slapstick with just the right dose of cruelty thrown in.",158
Weekend at Bernie's,Irreverent dead-body comedy has plenty of iffy stuff.,158
Weekend at Bernie's,A silly uninspired juvenile one-joke film.,158
Weekend at Bernie's,"Couldn't even drag a smile out of me. Chalk it up to either old age or the calcification of taste. Or just blame it on Silverman and McCarthy, who found their careers rightfully torn to shreds soon after the release of the film.",158
Weekend at Bernie's,"There are a few jokes that hit home quite successfully, but at 98 minutes, you'll probably be looking forward to this weekend's big finale.",158
Weekend at Bernie's,...might just be the ultimate wacky '80s comedy...,158
Weekend at Bernie's,Hilarious goofball comedy from the late 80s.,158
Weekend at Bernie's,Tasteless one-joke premise actually evokes laughs.,158
Basic Instinct,"An erotic thriller that initially hooks me with Sharon Stone's stellar performance as the dangerous and sensual femme fatale, but that, unfortunately, loses all its police intrigue with a gimmicky plot of sex, lies and murder. [Full review in Spanish]",159
Basic Instinct,"Basic Instinct is the work of fundamentally immature sensibilities. It uses women and differences in affectional preference as fodder for its misogynist, peek-a-boo mentality that views whatever it cannot understand as evil and threatening.",159

Basic Instinct,Basic Instinct is canon and you should watch it immediately if you haven’t already.,159
Basic Instinct,Sharon Stone radiates on screen in Paul Verhoeven's erotic thriller.,159
Basic Instinct,"Controversial and offensive. Enthralling and sexy. Featuring a star turn from Stone and no shortage of male character actors, Verhoeven and Eszterhas have crafted a sublime queer Erotic Thriller that doesn't play it safe or seek to appease audiences.",159
Basic Instinct,"Basic Instinct is a predictable, unintentionally self- mocking and ultimately dangerous piece of misogynist, anti-queer ideology.",159

Glengarry Glen Ross,"Incredible performances galore! A magnificent script splashed on the screen by an electric, powerful cast. [Full review in Spanish]",160
Glengarry Glen Ross,"A interesting but deficient film... As cinema, it lacks style and identity. [Full review in Spanish]",160
Glengarry Glen Ross,"Glengarry Glen Ross picks you up and throws you against a wall; then it holds you there for 90 minutes. That may not sound like a good time, but it's damned good filmmaking.",160
Glengarry Glen Ross,"I recommend Glengarry to all of you, but do not hope to leave the cinema with the last vestige of your faith in human nature still intact.",160
Glengarry Glen Ross,"Clearly some of the best work that the likes of Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin, and even the great Jack Lemmon, have ever done.",160
Glengarry Glen Ross,"While the dark view of human nature and brutal dialogue might keep faint hearts from the film, the cast manages to individualize and humanize the pugilistic wordplay so that its expressiveness never veers into offensiveness.",160
Glengarry Glen Ross,"Not an enjoyable watch, but in its own way it is exhilarating.",160
Glengarry Glen Ross,"As an expression of a great script, it really can't be beat.",160
Glengarry Glen Ross,"Head of the direction duties, James Foley, strings it together well, making it harmonise like the musical piece it has succeeded to be.",160

Top Gun,It’s a good thing it looks good ... because the plot is bare-thin.,161
Top Gun,"Top Gun: Maverick is the rare legacy sequel that eclipses the original in every way possible, thanks to mind-blowing action and great character growth.",161
Top Gun,"“Top Gun: Maverick,” if anything, proves that old-school big-budget blockbuster cinema that takes itself seriously isn’t just sorely missing from the yearly cinematic roster but still has the power to stand on its own.",161
Top Gun,Ohh right this is what movies used to be like.,161
Top Gun,Top Gun: Maverick is the reason why I go to the movies and why Tom Cruise is the biggest movie star in the world. WHAT. A RIDE.,161
Top Gun,"Maverick dished out generous amounts of bromance, action, and a truly-immersive narrative in swashbuckling style, and Cruise’s iconic grin was still the greatest thing to take away from it.",161
Top Gun,It is all of the flying sequences that are shot in such a way that it makes the moviegoer feel like they are a passenger that gives the movie its energy and makes it so much fun.,161
Top Gun,Top Gun: Maverick is a surprising stunner crafted with pure adrenaline and kerosene.,161

"Return of the Pink Panther, The","As always, Kwouk and especially Lom are given moments to shine.",163

Jean de Florette,"[VIDEO ESSAY] ""Jean de Florette / Manon des Sources"" is an emotionally potent movie whose lush depiction of Provence captures your imagination in such a tangible way that you feel as if you are living there during the period.",165
Jean de Florette,"Jean de Florette is as melodramatic as any soap opera, but its treatment is just a little askew, just off-center enough for the film to evolve into a moving and powerful pastoral tragedy.",165

Manon of the Spring,"It makes a great mistake in its epilogue, accumulating and revealing surprises, giving it the feeling of a cheap melodrama. [Full Review in Spanish]",166
Manon of the Spring,"Claude Bern's direction is confident and controlled, and the performances of Daniel Auteuil and Yves Montand have great authority; but perhaps the casting of Emmanuelle Bean is less happy.",166

Manon of the Spring,Another aching heartbreaker of a film by Berri that absorbs and rewards the audience for sticking with Manon on her sun-beaten quest.,166
Manon of the Spring,Wonderful and unforgettable.,166
Manon of the Spring,"Like its predecessor, Manon of the Spring is filled with marvelous photography, gorgeous rolling landscapes, and spectacular performances.",166

Manon of the Spring,Emmaunelle Beart is exquisite.,166
Private Benjamin,"Whether the collaboration of three screen writers gave this sometimes delightful, sometimes interminable motion picture an identity crisis, is anyone's guess.",167
Private Benjamin,"The film doesn't spoof the U.S. military as much as it pokes fun at people too fragile or ill-prepared for strict discipline, physical fitness, and zealous teamwork.",167
Private Benjamin,...a fairly familiar premise that's mostly employed to affable effect by filmmaker Howard Zieff...,167
Private Benjamin,"Within the limitations of the genre, this story of private Benjamin ends up being entertaining at times. It doesn't add anything new, but it brings to us a new and special performance from the brilliant actress Goldie Hawn. [Full Review in Spanish]",167
Private Benjamin,"""Private Benjamin"" seems coarse, sluggish and interminable as a comedy scenario, but the profoundly depressing aspect of it is that Goldie Hawn appears to be receding as a comedienne and emerging as a boss lady.",167
Private Benjamin,This is arguably although unfortunately Goldie Hawn's most memorable role.,167
Private Benjamin,"It's basically a one-joke effort, but that joke has Hawn throwing herself with great gusto into the role of a bewildered spoilt brat who comes good and her Oscar-nominated performance has huge charm.",167
Private Benjamin,"The pampered Hawn's reactions to rigorous training exercises, her interactions with her superiors, and a not-quite-successful love affair with French physician Armand Assante while on duty in Europe inspire plenty of laughs.",167

Cinema Paradiso,"A celebration of cinema's communal experience, this lovingly crafted ode to the joys projected upon the silver screen is a touching celebration of moviegoing.",170
Cinema Paradiso,"Although charming, its substance isn't overwhelmingly deep, serving more as a lighthearted, idealized, nostalgic coming-of-age tale than a stirring emotional investment.",170

"Empire Strikes Back, The",The Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars film because it took a cultural moment and redefined what it could mean.,172
"Empire Strikes Back, The",...unsatisfying by design...,172
"Empire Strikes Back, The",The look of The Empire Strikes Back is so strong. The way certain scenes are framed are not only good for story telling but are incredibly beautiful.,172

"Princess Bride, The","The film was always wonderful, featuring clever conceits plus perfect looking cast members and locations.",173
"Princess Bride, The","As the picture practically spoofs the endeavors of Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn, it's also competent enough to craft its own identity as a swashbuckling thriller.",173
"Princess Bride, The",Its well-developed characters and situations take us back to the literary myths of the genre as well as the language of classic cinema. [Full Review in Spanish],173

Raiders of the Lost Ark,"More spectacular and intricate action sequences may have been devised since, but it’s rare to find one with this level of bone-crunching realism and intensity.",174
Raiders of the Lost Ark,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is a movie so well-made and confident it didn’t need to have a sequel, but we’re sure glad it did.",174
Raiders of the Lost Ark,"One of the all-time greats. Harrison Ford is perfection-plus as Indiana Jones, so iconic a character that the AFI cited him as the second greatest movie hero of all time (just under Atticus Finch and just above James Bond).",174
Raiders of the Lost Ark,Raiders of the Lost Ark is still the ideal mold for action movies for the generation that followed.,174
Raiders of the Lost Ark,"From the moment we meet the iconic adventurer all the way to its glorious finale, it remains one of the most fun times one could have at the movies. One only wishes modern action-adventure films had one iota of the craft and creativity of this one.",174
Raiders of the Lost Ark,"To get to the point immediately, Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the most deliriously funny, ingenious and stylish American adventure movies ever made.",174
Raiders of the Lost Ark,"[Raiders of the Lost Ark] grabs you in the first shot, hurtles you through a series of incredible adventures, and deposits you back in reality two hours later -- breathless, dizzy, wrung-out, and with a silly grin on your face.",174
Raiders of the Lost Ark,"A glorious mixture of spectacular, fast-paced action and sly humor.",174
Raiders of the Lost Ark,"There was the almost exhausting excitement of the film itself. And at the same time a second emotion, a rush of gratitude which almost brought tears for the contagious joy and -- not to be corny about this -- the strength of the film's positive vision.",174
Raiders of the Lost Ark,"Raiders is the most fun to hit the screen since movies came in chapters. Reportedly, there are further adventures of Indiana Jones in the works. Let's hope so. Something this good deserves To Be Continued.",174
Brazil,"Gilliam, with a finely tuned aesthetic, constructs it as an Orwellian, nightmarish satire, which always raises its dark tone when it interrogates the omnipotence of the bureaucratic State on the basis of a dystopia. [Full review in Spanish]",175
Brazil,"From our post-9/11 viewpoint, Brazil’s biting social commentary comes across like an unheeded polemic against the slippery slope of surveillance and information gathering done in the name of national security.",175
Brazil,"What the film lacks in terms of a pandering narrative, it makes up for in lush backdrops, fantastic practical effects, and very real observations on surveillance states.",175
Brazil,"Gilliam’s best at complex science fiction, featuring a perfect mix of existential depression and absurd humor.",175
Brazil,It offers sharp consumer parodies and supplies some outrageous flashes of brilliance to take your breath away.,175
Brazil,"Brazil understands the need for escape when suppressed by the worlds monotony, but it also acknowledges the despair of dreamy ideals. They are, after all, ideals, and by definition unreachable.",175
Brazil,The world building in the film is another of its strongest points. The visual details throughout add so much to the story without ever being too distracting...,175
Brazil,"An uproarious satire of bureaucracy, technology, society, and humanity that proves to be one of the greatest movies of all time, sci-fi or otherwise.",175
Brazil,"It's like a stoned, slapstick 1984: a nightmare comedy in which the comedy is just an aspect of the nightmarishness.",175
Brazil,"Inventive, prophetic black comedy; lots of violence, mayhem.",175
Aliens,"From the small character details to the massive set-pieces, Cameron expands the Alien mythology and switches sub genres seamlessly. It truly is a perfect sequel.",176
Aliens,"[James Cameron] takes the franchise in another direction by raising the stakes and turning the sequel into an action-packed, war epic [while] retaining the dread-inducing feel and tone of the first movie.",176
Aliens,"Let's not mince words: Aliens is the greatest horror movie since Frankenstein. Here is a rare instance in which a sequel is infinitely superior to the original. Alien, the 1979 thriller, now seems like a preliminary sketch.",176
Aliens,"Cameron is a master of machinery and weaponry, a technical wizard who replaces Scott's refinement with his own kind of muscularity... But with either film, you leave the theater drained, physically exhausted, well-rewarded for all your suffering.",176
Aliens,What can I say? Aliens is the scariest and most exciting movie I've seen in several years. My adrenalin was still racing an hour later. It's involving. It has well-drawn characters. It has consistency. And Sigourney Weaver gives a dazzling performance.,176
Aliens,"The long-awaited sequel to Alien proves to be an extraordinary treat, as perfectly realized a thrill-a-second screamer as has ever come along.",176
Aliens,"It is pure action built around the barest of plots. Yet, the characters, the catastrophes and the world Cameron and his special effects technicians envision is rich with texture.",176
Aliens,"What a difference an ""s"" makes -- for the good.",176
Aliens,"Delivering generously on the promise he demonstrated in The Terminator, Cameron has given us a seamless motion picture that transforms its not-for-all-tastes subject matter into the stuff of across-the-board appeal.",176
Aliens,"A noisy, hectoring, mechanical piece of filmmaking. It beats you like a drum, but there's no resonance.",176
"Good, The Bad and The Ugly, The","…a revisionist Western, and a rare genre entry with loaded satirical intent that’s always hiding in plain sight…captures a master director in absolute full flow…",177
"Good, The Bad and The Ugly, The","Ennio Morricone’s soundtrack is widely regarded as the best of his career, with the moody, two-note flute melody... an instantly recognisable refrain that is folksy and avant-garde at the same time.",177
"Good, The Bad and The Ugly, The",It makes a case for Sergio Leone as a true artist and it slowly reveals itself to have real emotional heft when you begin considering some of the ambitious themes that Leone tackles.,177
"Good, The Bad and The Ugly, The","While it may not be the best Western ever made - heck, it's not even the best Western Leone ever made - it's clearly the work of a master filmmaker whose style has never grown stale.",177
"Good, The Bad and The Ugly, The","If you only see one spaghetti Western in your lifetime, this is the one to see.",177
"Good, The Bad and The Ugly, The","The score for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is magnificent. The main theme that plays over the titles is simultaneously of a specific time and also timeless.",177
"Good, The Bad and The Ugly, The","Leone's penchant for contrasting two kinds of shots, close-ups and long shots, finds its corollary in the gray or blue...Leone turns gray soldiers blue in the simplest way possible. Movies were invented for ideas like that.",177
"Good, The Bad and The Ugly, The",Boasts what is often considered the greatest showdown ever filmed.,177
"Good, The Bad and The Ugly, The",The quintessential spaghetti western.,177
"Good, The Bad and The Ugly, The","As in an opera, the characters are archetypes, not figures we particularly identify with; as in an opera, we waited a long time for the inevitable ghastly conclusion; as in an opera, Leone seeks (and delivers) a kind of ecstatic dread.",177
12 Angry Men,"A film like 12 Angry Men comes around once in a lifetime, and it will remain a blueprint for what a masterpiece looks like.",178
12 Angry Men,"This arguably remains Sidney Lumet's most compelling work, a sweaty, sustained drama that milks its claustrophobic setting for all it’s worth.",178
12 Angry Men,12 Angry Men is one of the best courtroom dramas in cinematic history.,178
12 Angry Men,"It’s a near perfect mix of theme and setting, personal drama and social commentary, a microcosm that suggests an entire world outside the frame ...",178
12 Angry Men,"Sidney Lumet's solid success is achieved without even once resorting to flashbacks or other standard procedures of the film trade. The secret rests in spirited dialogue, realistic setting and, of course, the excellent cast of outstanding character actors.",178
12 Angry Men,Within its simplicity there is a freshness and ingenuousness about Twelve Angry Men uncommon in a slickly sophisticated film industry.,178
12 Angry Men,"One has to imagine the dramatic imagination that went into creating this fascinating, psychologically realistic motion picture, which, from start to finish, never changes its subject or its location.",178
12 Angry Men,A court drama that transcends time or place; a real masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish],178
12 Angry Men,If you have never seen the film I cannot recommend it enough.,178
12 Angry Men,Reginald Rose's script is one of deep revelation.,178
"Clockwork Orange, A","Kubrick creates a harsh and unforgiving picture of society in this film, a society that thinks in black and white refusing to entertain color. The quick and easy fix is seemingly the only one worth indulging in.",179
"Clockwork Orange, A","Kubrick, ever the provocateur, would probably enjoy its enduring legacy, and recoil at the same time.",179
"Clockwork Orange, A","The rare Kubrick film that feels like a misfire, and although the impeccable filmmaking techniques are still admirable, it’ll be tough appreciating the full effect of the shocking content when you’re checking your watch every five minutes.",179
"Clockwork Orange, A","I can’t accept that Kubrick is merely reflecting this post-assassinations, post-Manson mood; I think he’s catering to it. I think he wants to dig it.",179
"Clockwork Orange, A",An exploration of the power psychological games can have on us. [Full review in Spanish],179
"Clockwork Orange, A","The cast is all you could hope for, and Kubrick handles his medium with a confidence almost insolent. For the rest, he has given us the most audacious of horror films. And the most inhuman.",179
"Clockwork Orange, A",…a sensational story of youth both revolting and betrayed…,179
"Clockwork Orange, A","Kubrick’s intention is thus not for the audience to identify with Alex, but to see retrospectively that they are in the same situation as Alex, if they are to believe what they are watching.",179
"Clockwork Orange, A","...while it might be tempting to say Kubricks views were perverse, this film shows there was a deep-seated nuance to his observations that cut deeply to the core of our own propensity for violence as both the cause and effect of our own moral failings.",179
"Clockwork Orange, A",Dazzling but problematic.,179
Apocalypse Now,"Years and years from now, when Coppola’s budget and his problems have long been forgotten, “Apocalypse” will still stand, I think, as a grand and grave and insanely inspired gesture of filmmaking.",180
Apocalypse Now,"It's precisely in the last 25 minutes that Apocalypse Now dissolves into gibberish. I've seen the film three times with two different endings, and neither ending has been satisfactory. That's because the problem with the picture isn't at its very end.",180
Apocalypse Now,"Some critics fault Coppola for not delivering a seamless, flawless film. But this is to misperceive and misread the film in a crucial way. The film by definition couldn't be flawless. It attempts too much.",180
Apocalypse Now,"Coppola has used the Hollywood genius, which is for films of action and adventure, and built into it something for which Hollywood usually has small talent, namely a philosophical meditation.",180
Apocalypse Now,"Some ultimate and flawless perfection may have been missed. But as a noble use of the medium and as a timeless expression of a national anguish, it towers over anything that has been attempted by an American film maker in a very long time.",180
Apocalypse Now,"Though as high art this movie may have its problems, it is a complete movie, a huge piece of work that is at once a technical masterpiece and a thing of lyrical, lethal beauty. This will be the film to see in 1979.",180
Apocalypse Now,"Apocalypse Now is emotionally obtuse and intellectually empty. It is not so much an epic account of a grueling war as an incongruous, extravagant monument to artistic self-defeat.",180
Apocalypse Now,Decompression [after leaving the theater] takes a long time. You're still submerged for quite a while in its climate of oppressive sin and maddened dissolution... The parking lot doesn't seem quite like a parking lot.,180
Apocalypse Now,"Francis Ford Coppola has made a magnificent movie -- not necessarily apocalyptic, but definitely a humane exploration of a most inhumane topic.",180
Apocalypse Now,"A sour, sad muddle. The battle scenes are arresting, if you're into battle scenes. But oh, that dreary philosophy that wrecks the final 30 minutes.",180
Return of the Jedi,It takes 80 minutes for Return of the Jedi to kick in when Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Darth Vader meet again.,181
Return of the Jedi,"This is perhaps the goofiest entry in the original trilogy which is something I adore, mainly thanks to the Ewoks.",181
Return of the Jedi,"Even after 40 years, Return of the Jedi remains the most flat-out entertaining Star Wars movie of the bunch.",181
Return of the Jedi,"Sorry Empire stans, but nothing the saga has presented thus far comes anywhere close to the emotional trauma unfolding here. Hauntingly scored by John Williams, who almost equals the impact of his seminal Imperial March, it’s goosebump-inducing.",181
Return of the Jedi,Without fail “Return of the Jedi” ignites a near childlike enthusiasm inside of me every time I watch it.,181
Return of the Jedi,"Given how well Return of the Jedi was put together from a technical perspective, and how entertaining the whole thing ends up being, it's difficult not to enjoy the film on very basic levels, but it stands as the original trilogy's odd man out.",181
Return of the Jedi,The Return Of The Jedi offers enough moments that is not only a fitting entry into the franchise but what was thought of at the time as a fitting conclusion to it as well.,181
Return of the Jedi,"Return of the Jedi is easy to nitpick, but its best qualities are simply that it's got the aura of an original trilogy film.",181
Return of the Jedi,"...the decline that began in The Empire Strikes Back has becomes a malaise by now, with continuity stretches making nonsense of the narrative...",181
Return of the Jedi,"It's well constructed, tonally in spirit, and hugely enjoyable, but the Force simply isn't as strong in this one.",181
GoodFellas,"All I take out of Goodfellas narratively is an unpleasant experience with unpleasant people, and that’s it ... I don’t like or care about any character.",182
GoodFellas,"Succinct filmmaking, satisfying performances and memorable dialogue assures Goodfellas position as a classic in the genre and Hollywood.",182
GoodFellas,"Goodfellas excels in detailing the protagonist's journey within the mob, with narration that enriches rather than detracts. Despite a slower final act, it remains gripping.",182
GoodFellas,"Goodfellas captures the pulse of gangster life, not just to understand what motivates these people and how they compartmentalize their choices, but to supply the audience with a shock treatment of aversion.",182
GoodFellas,"It aged perfectly, even though many imitations have emerged in the last 33 years. In dealing with shades of grey, detestable but relatable characters, brutal violence and themes of family, friendship and crime, it feels timeless. Full review in Spanish.",182
GoodFellas,"It's staggering: a feast of virtuoso Steadicam tracking shots, ironically pell-mell editing, and a mix of baroque visual satire, off-key realism, and brilliant, scabrous dialogue that elevates gutter badinage to the high verbal style of a Jacobean drama.",182
GoodFellas,The only argument you’re bound to get into concerning Martin Scorsese’s GoodFellas is the degree of its greatness -- if it’s the most brilliant cinematic tour de force of the decade or merely this year. After 10 minutes I felt I had already seen 25 films.,182
GoodFellas,Scorsese constantly reveals the skull behind the smile. Seldom has violence been portrayed less glamorously or with more moral effectiveness.,182
GoodFellas,"It is intimately personal, yet so removed as to remain nonjudgmental, and therefore totally trustworthy. We give into it without reservation, because its maker assures us with every shot, every move that he knows exactly what he’s doing.",182
GoodFellas,"GoodFellas, written by Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorsese, and directed by Scorsese, is the greatest film ever made about the sensual and monetary lure of crime, and the whole perversely brilliant movie comes into focus in a single, staggering shot.",182
Alien,"Totally committed to jump scares, this latest outing for the franchise is a far better film than the recent prequels.",183
Alien,"As blockbuster franchises go, Romulus isn’t a bad film. But it suffers from the perennial blockbuster problem, which is that it doesn’t believe in its own world or its own themes.",183
Alien,"The plot may be one “Alien” cliche after another, but the physical production is solid.",183
Alien,"You get exactly what you expect here, which is good in a way but also a shame in a way because it doesn't break any new ground save for one new gruesome alien. If you go in expecting a fairly decent bloody new Alien flick, that's what you'll get.",183
Alien,"If Alvarez has leaned more into the horror of what takes place in the movie's final 20 minutes instead of fan servicing us, maybe we would've come away with a more original vision. As it is, Romulus is mostly pastiche, albeit a beautifully rendered one.",183
Alien,"A strong, sick and scary entry in this 45-year-old franchise.",183
Alien,This is a film that takes some time out for wonder and awe.,183
Alien,"In short, this is a sequel that falls prey to its own ambitions. [Full review in Spanish]",183
Alien,"There are interesting ideas here, but we're beating a dead horse to a degree here.",183
Alien,"Alvarez isn’t just keeping a wheezy franchise alive, but giving us a reason to feel invested in its ongoing life.",183
Army of Darkness,"Raimi's special effects and camera work really elevate this pulp, fantasy film and make this an immersive experience.",184
Army of Darkness,"...a daft but enjoyable romp…catnip for fans of Campbell, this is probably his finest hour, making a droll, lantern jawed hero with a deft penchant for quips and an ability to accessorise",184
Army of Darkness,"Blending almost nonstop violence with humorous parody, Sam Raimi’s latest excursion into horror-kitsch should prove a crowd-pleaser for the mall trade and perhaps a mite beyond.",184
Army of Darkness,"Bruce Campbell, the rugged star-survivor of The Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2: Dead Before Dawn, takes his most incendiary trip yet in Army of Darkness, a hilariously extravagant sequel to those low-budget, tongue-in-cheek fright flicks.",184
Army of Darkness,"Replete with thumping horse hooves, the battle cries of lusty men and the banshee screams of the living dead, Raimi's movie comes at you with a noisy, jokey swagger. Its hero even says ""groovy"" and gets away with it.",184
Army of Darkness,"Here's the problem: Bruce Campbell's character is a complete stiff, and so is everyone else he meets who isn't a special effect. The result is that we couldn't care less who wins any battle in the movie no matter how inventively photographed.",184
Army of Darkness,"Benefiting enormously from Raimi's brisk, no-nonsense direction, it shows again that he can fill a broader canvas with complicated effects, masking the fact that there's nothing terribly original on screen.",184
Army of Darkness,Army of Darkness is quite simply the best Bob Hope comedy Bob Hope never made.,184
Army of Darkness,"There isn't a dead spot in Army of Darkness, which runs a brief 77 minutes, and suitably so: This is, in many ways, a live-action cartoon. It's overdone, yes, but also irresistible.",184
Army of Darkness,"With virtually no narrative to connect its wall-to-wall mindless action sequences, Army of Darkness is either a botched attempt at some kind of elaborate allegory or a botched attempt to bring comic-strip panels to life.",184
Psycho,"The film’s crisp and controlled style is immediately appealing, but things become repetitive in the film’s second act. Luckily the open-ended and frenetic conclusion makes for an even more compelling examination of the film’s themes.",185
Psycho,"I will not give away the ending to American Psycho, but I will say this: The last three scenes are implausible and unnecessary (and totally unrelated to the book) and the ending includes the cheapest, most manipulative trick in filmmaking.",185
Psycho,"... A ferociously intelligent, horribly violent and darkly funny parable of greed and violence.",185
Psycho,"Christian Bale is razor sharp... as blank corporate drone Patrick Bateman... a preening tiger in designer suits whose speaking voice is part salesman, part self-help guru, and completely artificial",185
Psycho,"I couldn't connect with this movie at all. In a way, the story kind of goes nowhere. But at the same time, Christian Bale goes for broke and you can't help but appreciate it.",185
Psycho,"Despite an incredible performance by Christian Bale, this movie was a struggle to get through given that none of the characters had any redeeming qualities.",185
Psycho,"Expertly made and does what it's trying to do very well, but I just can't fully connect with this one.",185
Psycho,"American Psycho directly addresses the horror of capitalism, in which other people are just props for the fantasies of men who get wealthier by the second.",185
Psycho,The idea that this is all a fantasy inside Bateman's head is brilliantly realised in his growing realisation that he's been able to get away with all of this in plain sight.,185
Psycho,"There are times where this film is satire at its best. It's also horrific, violent and stomach-turning. Christian Bale is incredible in this movie and he commits to making Bateman completely deplorable.",185
"Blues Brothers, The","As a little kid, 'The Blues Brothers' taught me the foundations of American music. It also taught me that cops, Nazis and good old boys are to be mercilessly mocked and messed with.",186
"Blues Brothers, The",It ends up frequenting common places where the dry humor supplied by Aykroyd and Belushi's chemistry wears out like a car tire. [Full review in Spanish],186
"Blues Brothers, The",One of the great American comedy films... It’s just a joy to watch even forty three years on. John Belushi was never better as the lead. He’s funny just standing there.,186
"Blues Brothers, The",More energetic than funny.,186
"Blues Brothers, The","No matter that the big screen story gets convoluted and improbable-the characters make it work. They sing classic rhythm and blues songs well enough, but better yet, perform with the greats.",186
"Blues Brothers, The","The Blues Brothers are a popular novelty, and have a definite tongue-in-cheek appeal. But this film does nothing with the characters, except to portray them as a couple of one-sided and unlikable hoods.",186
"Blues Brothers, The","The Blues Brothers is the year's best film to date; one of the, all-time great comedies; the best movie ever made in Chicago. All are true, and, boy, is that ever a surprise.",186
"Blues Brothers, The","The Blues Brothers is unlike anything you've ever seen before, at once touching and far-far out -- and most of all, best of all, it is hugely entertaining.",186
"Blues Brothers, The","Too many times, The Blues Brothers is static when it should be ecstatic. When it tries to hit the heights, it's not nearly dizzying enough And when it should soar, it simply hangs there.",186
"Blues Brothers, The","Despite the temporary lift that the old pros give the picture, it is difficult for the non-cultist to feel anything but dismay, again, that so much has been squandered to produce so little that is truly artful or genuinely entertaining.",186
"Godfather: Part II, The","""Godfather II"" ties all its elements together into a nuanced yet epic vision of an American family and how its downfall parallels that of America itself in the first half of the 20th century.",187
"Godfather: Part II, The",The storytelling is leisurely and masterful; Coppola at the very peak of his powers.,187
"Godfather: Part II, The","If you like your drama on a low-key level with excellent acting all around, then Godfather II is where it's at. I wasn't a great fan of the original but this sequel succeeds in unraveling the saga of a simple Mafia family.",187
"Godfather: Part II, The","Through a compelling dual character study, the sequel explores the intertwined yet distinct paths of its protagonists. The result is a breathtaking display of filmmaking leaving us in awe of its expansive scope, attention to detail, and sheer perfection.",187
"Godfather: Part II, The",The finest example of when a sequel is superior to its predecessor. The Godfather Part II is one of the best films of all-time. A masterpiece. It's that simple. Full review in Spanish,187
"Godfather: Part II, The",Lauded in some corners (although not this one) as being superior to its predecessor.,187
"Godfather: Part II, The","The Godfather films have set home-video standards for decades, and that trend continues with Paramounts astonishing 4K restorations.",187
"Godfather: Part II, The",It’s an epic vision of the corruption of America.,187
"Godfather: Part II, The","One leaves the theatre stunned by the cold, ruthless violence of which men who are so otherwise civilised (they, have nice homes, wear nice clothes, love their families and friends dearly) are capable.",187
"Godfather: Part II, The",Director Francis Ford Coppola furnished a fully-fashioned gangster melodrama in the first film: in this one he stretches his talent to encompass a genuine American tragedy.,187
Full Metal Jacket,"As Private Leonard “Gomer Pyle” Lawrence, D’Onofrio encapsulates the impact that military brainwashing can have on soldiers and their mental health in a way that is better than expected",188
Full Metal Jacket,"What happened to the Kubrick who used to slip in sly, subtle jokes and little editing tricks? This may be his worst movie.",188
Full Metal Jacket,"Full Metal Jacket is violent, caustic, ironic, and cold, an amoral object formed from a camera gliding majestically across slow-motion carnage while refusing to blink an eye or shed a tear.",188
Full Metal Jacket,"Kubrick is trying to make a movie about madness and chaos, but he won't give in to the chaos.",188
Full Metal Jacket,The most horrifying moments of Full Metal Jacket are those in which the young Americans gladly assist in their own damnation.,188
Full Metal Jacket,"A hard-hitting movie laced with moments of dark humour and brimming with social commentary, Full Metal Jacket is viewed as one of the all-time great war movie.",188
Full Metal Jacket,Kubrick had a way of making the audience become invested in the characters of his films and created some truly memorable ones.,188
Full Metal Jacket,It was a gross injustice that Ermey was not nominated for his tremendous performance.,188
Full Metal Jacket,"A nicely contrasting soundtrack, intense action sequences, mesmerizing sets, excellent photography, and believable characters contribute to this poignant thriller.",188
Full Metal Jacket,Full Metal Jacket is a master study in indoctrination and fundamental identity shifts. Every moment of the film builds and builds on Kubrick's ideas...,188
"Grand Day Out, A",Gromit's silent routine works nicely against Wallace's limited intelligence.,189
"Grand Day Out, A","This is the first, and my favorite, of the three clay-animated ""Wallace and Gromit"" shorts.",189
"Grand Day Out, A","In retrospect, the film is entertaining but not as impressive as its successors",189
"Grand Day Out, A",Nick Park is a genius. Enough said.,189

Henry V,"The film’s point of view leaves you without elation, but the actors are so up that you feel their pride in working on true dramatic poetry.",190
Henry V,Completely unnecessary. [Full review in Spanish],190
Henry V,"Reigniting Shakespeare's poetry on screen, the movie is not only accessible to a general audience -- it has enough excitement, wit and suspense to hold its own in the Hollywood fray.",190
Henry V,"Branagh has made a hotblooded, lively and moving Henry V that speaks pertinently to a new generation.",190
Henry V,"There is a great deal of value in Branagh`s version, not least in his own lead performance as a soft, indefinite Henry who defines himself over the course of the play.",190
Henry V,"If Olivier gave us the glint of sunlight on armor and the wind roaring through the pennants and flags, Branagh gives us the rot, the mold, the wounds and the crusted blood underneath.",190
Henry V,"This is a solidly mounted production, with the contrasts between the finery of the court and the grime of the battlefield as striking as the excellent cast of noted thespians.",190
Henry V,"Aside from the confusing scenes with Falstaff, it all works very well and is very impressive considering it is Branagh's directorial debut.",190
Henry V,"There's a boldness to Branagh's Henry V, which shows off the cinematic possibilities of Shakespeare without a lot of distracting razzle-dazzle.",190
Henry V,"[VIDEO ESSAY] Toward ""turning many years into an hourglass,"" Branagh the screenwriter condenses ""King Henry the Fifth,"" while adding in elements from the first and second parts of ""King Henry the Fourth."" The effect is seamless.",190
Amadeus,"Found an irresistible angle in telling the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart by routing it through the bitter jealousy and hatred of his less-talented rival, Antonio Salieri (40th anniversary)",191
Amadeus,A grandly entertaining period piece.,191
Amadeus,"Lavish and flamboyant in every manner. F. Murray Abraham’s vile and sinister performance as the envious Salieri, a man with more desire to produce music than God gave him talent to create, is one for the ages.",191
Amadeus,"Decorated with a powdered-sugar sweetness and creamy lavishness unseen since the days of Josef von Sternberg, and performed by an eager to please, rootin'-tootin' American cast that would be comfortable in Oklahoma!, Amadeus is junk food par excellence.",191
Amadeus,"Mozart's subtle, timeless melodies are what sustains Amadeus over its dramatic rough spots, though Shaffer and Forman do manage to end things on a grace note.",191
Amadeus,"The film makes too many claims to verisimilitude to allow for suspension of disbelief... But the excitement of absorption in what remains a riveting dramatic story, in the vitality of the images, are almost enough to override all the objections.",191
Amadeus,The subject of artistic creation is typically handled badly in the movies... [Amadeus] treats the subject of creativity in a fresh way.,191
Amadeus,"This is Mozart as an eighteenth-century Bruce Springsteen, and yet (here is the genius of the movie) there is nothing cheap or unworthy about the approach.",191
Amadeus,"Mr. Forman, who created a highly original film out of the virtually formless stage production of Hair, has preserved the fascinating heart of Mr. Shaffer's play, and made it available to millions who might never enter a legitimate theater. Well done.",191
Amadeus,"Amadeus is a smashing entertainment, a culture maven's orgy, and the best advertisement for classical music we've ever had. Go see it. Go hear it.",191
Raging Bull,"Scorsese effortlessly fuses top-drawer acting, pumping narrative drive and blitzkrieg camera technique to deliver a giddy, claustrophobic classic.",192
Raging Bull,Martin Scorsese perfects a configuration of the biopic as self-recognized fiction.,192
Raging Bull,"The brutality of Raging Bull is intense, a mood Scorsese maintains consistently. And, connected with that, is the director's search for, if not beauty, then poetry, within that vivid viciousness. He succeeds in that search.",192
Raging Bull,"De Niro playing La Motta in Raging Bull is beyond mere typecasting. It is an apotheosis. With La Motta as technical adviser, De Niro, an actor with a passion for authenticity, has found the ideal outlet for his singular talent.",192
Raging Bull,"An intensely personal piece of work made to exacting specifications by a team of perfectionists. The result is like the man it portrays -- undeniably powerful and distinctive but not especially pleasant, an inspirer of awe but not affection.",192
Raging Bull,"Even if Scorsese and De Niro have created a movie that defies categories, the sports film will never seem quite the same, and the boxing division has a new heavyweight against which past and future efforts will be measured.",192
Raging Bull,"You certainly don't emerge from this entertainment uplifted, inspired or wishing to emulate a hero. Instead you've had your nose rubbed in the bloody, seamy side of the ""manly act"" and got to know one of its best, but least happy, champions.",192
Raging Bull,"There is appalling violence in Raging Bull, but as in Greek tragedy the violence is the thunderbolt of shock of a total apprehension of the humanity of its characters.",192
Raging Bull,"Between them, De Niro and Scorsese and their associates end up with a breathtakingly new dimension of memory and regret. If only I could feel the slightest moral resonance as well -- but I can't, and that makes all the difference.",192
Raging Bull,"The impacted hell of city life, the incessant noise and motion, seen and heard as it washes over and around one man, is bearable only because Scorsese makes it beautiful. Almost overbearingly beautiful, but not quite.",192
"Right Stuff, The",It still thrills with its expert casting and dazzling visuals.,193
"Right Stuff, The","The Right Stuff gives off a pleasurable hum: it’s the writer-director Philip Kaufman’s enjoyment of the subject, the actors, and moviemaking itself.",193
"Right Stuff, The",This timely delve into the past - warts and all - to uncover the roots of a future we are now participating in has a basic ingredient that so many films lately have lacked. And that is integrity,193
"Right Stuff, The",Episode 12: Away We Go,193
"Right Stuff, The","Where 2001: A Space Odyssey depicted astronauts (and mankind) as being at the mercy of some higher, alien intelligence, The Right Stuff finds its characters imposing their will on the unknown.",193
"Right Stuff, The",The Right Stuff is so clumsily shot and has such a simple structure that boredom can threaten to drown the viewer's patience. [Full Review in Spanish],193
"Right Stuff, The","Philip Kaufman's 1983 film is an efficient and absorbing recapitulation of the main events of Tom Wolfe's book that still never succeeds in capturing the inner drives and ethics of the test pilots and astronauts - the ""right stuff"" never materializes.",193
"Right Stuff, The","Rarely has a film made a historic accomplishment seem so vivid and personal... It makes you wonder, quite suddenly, why there aren't more movies like this.",193
"Right Stuff, The",The Right Stuff is a spectacular celebration of those heroes of the skies -- those fly jocks who fought the demons of space to launch a new era in American air technology.,193
"Right Stuff, The",Masculinely romantic...,193
"Terminator, The",Guerilla filmmaking with a newcomer’s edge has rarely been put to better use.,195
"Terminator, The","The Terminator, produced on a $6.5 million budget, reveals moments where the updated 4K video quality highlights its modest production roots.",195
"Terminator, The","It’s engrossing, suspenseful, has a personality all of its own and absolutely stands the test of time.",195
"Terminator, The","While Cameron would make better, more ambitious, and certainly more successful projects in the decades to come, none would feel so foundational to Cameron’s auteurism as The Terminator",195
"Terminator, The","Despite its simple plot and uninspired dialogue, The Terminator is an otherwise well-oiled machine propelled forward by the strength of James Cameron’s direction, Stan Winston’s special effects, and Schwarzenegger’s terrifying performance.",195
"Terminator, The",Perhaps no other villain of the 80s is as iconic as Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator.,195
"Terminator, The","This action flick has more than a few moments of intimacy, lyricism and tenderness as it confronts the bleak prospects for mankind from a matriarchal point of view.",195
"Terminator, The",It's a powerhouse sci-fi action adventure which is undeniably the most thrill-packed movie- going experience for ages,195
"Terminator, The","Although not a horror movie in the strictest sense, the film also introduced us to one of cinema's most iconic final girls...",195
"Terminator, The","Never has a role been so perfectly sculpted for the Austrian bodybuilder, who possesses a powerful screen presence with little more than his menacing silhouette.",195
Dead Poets Society,"Though it’s marginally overlong, the script is absorbing.",196
Dead Poets Society,It's extremely manipulative but it still works,196
Dead Poets Society,An achingly beautiful story of high school boys who give up the guards of their masculinity and family expectations to believe in something beautiful and real.,196
Dead Poets Society,"An Oscar-winning drama about self-discovery, free-thinking, and the unfortunate costs that sometimes comes with them.",196
Dead Poets Society,This excellent film turns a refrain into an axiom. [Full review in Spanish},196
Dead Poets Society,"We never are privy to Keatings’s personal life, nor do we quite grasp why such a talented individual is devoted to pedagogy.",196
Dead Poets Society,"I'd originally found it inspiring in 1989 but upon reviewing DPS in 2021, I've come to see it as the poster child (or movie poster) for the insidious, creeping way Hollywood helped sneak communism, Trojan-horse-wise, into America via the movies.",196
Dead Poets Society,Robin Williams may have been famous because of his comedy work but his non-comedy role in Dead Poets Society is one of his best performances.,196
Dead Poets Society,A refreshing if obvious drama.,196
Dead Poets Society,"On the surface Robin Williams appears to be giving his standard performance as Prof. Keating - witty, sincere and lovable. But there's much more here.",196
"Graduate, The","The camera and editing moves differently than other movies of its day and the deliberate uses of light, shadow, angle, and focus amaze me to no end.",197
"Graduate, The","A withering dramedy that pulls no punches as it builds to one of the most iconic and haunting endings ever put to screen, The Graduate remains as clear-eyed as ever.",197
"Graduate, The","A brilliant and funny satire on the affluent, materialistic society.",197
"Graduate, The","The Graduate engages its audience almost exclusively at the level of events until the grandly satisfying conclusion, when its problems (Benjamin's problems) seem to arrive at a happy solution.",197
"Graduate, The","You really can’t miss Bancroft’s iconic performance, but I wouldn’t blame anybody for feeling a bit disappointed by the film itself. The years have not been kind to it and it now seems shallow and overly calculated.",197
"Graduate, The","It may not be the most tight-knit script and some key character relationships are underwritten. But anchored by some stellar performances and a great soundtrack, it’s still a lot of fun.",197
"Graduate, The","I suggest that you see The Graduate for fun, and the hell with the next American cinema coming of age.",197
"Graduate, The",Something that any lover of American Cinema should see.,197
"Graduate, The","It’s hard to say which is best -- the direction, the script, or the performances by Dustin Hoffman, Katherine Ross, and Anne Bancroft. Together they achieve a major American film triumph.",197
"Graduate, The",...a striking and thoroughly entertaining effort that boasts one of Hoffman's best performances.,197
Nikita,Luc Besson applies his usual slick stylistics to this durable French thriller .,198
Nikita,La Femme Nikita is quintessential Besson at his best.,198
Nikita,This elegant sanguine spiral is tremendously fun. [Full review in Spanish],198
Nikita,A super-stylish and exciting work from writer-producer-director Luc Besson.,198
Nikita,"Nikita starts out as a callous sociopath, raging violently against the world, but she learns to get in touch with her emotions while being trained to become an unfeeling assassin.",198
Nikita,"Luc Besson's script and direction would prove inspirational to subsequent movies, crafting a blueprint for a number of likeminded spy yarns.",198
Nikita,"A cool sensory indulgence, but irksomely lightweight.",198
Nikita,"[VIDEO] Before it spawned a cornucopia of television series knock-offs, writer/director Luc Besson's stylized 1990 French crime thriller set a new standard for the girl-with-a-gun movie trope.",198
Nikita,Beware Nikita. Not for kids.,198
Nikita,"A spy version of Pygmalion, complete with perverse romance, Nikita was well ahead of the curve when it came to women warriors as modern shoot-'em-up stars.",198
"Bridge on the River Kwai, The","There are very few examples each year of cinematic enterprises that are carried out with such intelligence and above all with such care. But the quality of this film must ultimately be put in its artistic place, and that place is not the highest.",199
"Bridge on the River Kwai, The","One of the great, action-packed epics of the late 50s, The Bridge on the River Kwai is an exceptional case study about the hysteria of war and the pride that comes before the fall.",199
"Bridge on the River Kwai, The",One of the greatest and most satisfying endings in all film history...,199
"Bridge on the River Kwai, The","For all of its grim setting and tragic conclusion, The Bridge on the River Kwai becomes a slyly humorous study in the limitations as well as the stoical splendors of the British “military mind.""",199
"Bridge on the River Kwai, The","I have rarely seen, in a film of action, a better cast. In the end, then, it is the people who count, and as individuals, obstinate, proud, muddled, humiliated, fanatically intent on the task in hand: not as the puppets who infest most war films.",199
"Bridge on the River Kwai, The","The film is rather misshapen, particularly in the sections featuring William Holden, and the action that detonates the explosive finish isn't quite clear. However, Alec Guinness is compelling as the English Colonel Nicholson.",199
"Bridge on the River Kwai, The","This gripping tale will keep you tied to your seat thanks to the brilliant effectiveness with which Director David Lean has tied together script, casting and technical demands.",199
"Bridge on the River Kwai, The",The movie’s tense climax is a perfect marriage of editing and camerawork.,199
"Bridge on the River Kwai, The",Director David Lean had a unique eye for aesthetics which served him well on the set.,199
"Bridge on the River Kwai, The","Led by its star-studded cast, The Bridge on the River Kwai is a technical achievement in and of itself.",199
"Shining, The","Despite The Outlook’s advantages, a hysterical, bookworm, couch potato, chain smoking wife beats it. Kubrick did not intend to create a film about evil’s Achilles heel, but I left with that message. Be a mess, but fight.",200
"Shining, The","With an out-of-this-world cast, ""The Shining"" remains a cult film, even after 44 years and it’s ideal for a cold winter evening.",200
"Shining, The",The supernatural joins forces with psychosis in Stanley Kubrick’s superb adaptation of a Stephen King bestseller.,200
"Shining, The","Stanley Kubrick somehow manages to feel restrained and more ambitious than ever, delivering a harrowing and nightmarish case study in the impact of isolation and familial resentment.",200
"Shining, The","The Shining might be one of the most accessible classics to new viewers of today to understand why it is, in fact, one of the greatest and most influential horror films of all time. The ending is still mind-blowing after all these years.",200
"Shining, The","Yet, The Shining, which was his third to last film, was akin to the genre films of his past such as Dr. Strangelove and 2001: A Space Odyssey where he explored the essence of humanity in a way unlike any other filmmaker.",200
"Shining, The",Kubrick sabotages his own thesis in the most knuckleheaded way conceivable: we can't be charged as accomplices in horror when there is no horror.,200
"Shining, The","Kubrick, however, doesn't really seem interested in the ""shining"" or in the hotel's supernatural forces generally... The result is a movie fatally flawed artistically.",200
"Shining, The",An unending roller coaster of terror that knows exactly how to get under the skin of anyone who watches it.,200
"Shining, The","There are a few terrific thrills, and some eerie moments of dislocation that only Kubrick could achieve, but most of the movie is unfelt, unscary, and bizarrely heavy-handed. It's the first pompous haunted-house movie.",200
Evil Dead II,"Raimi's movie is a glorious goof, which picks up some of Lovecraft's tossed off ideas as an excuse for gross-out physical comedy and joyful filmmaking.",201
Evil Dead II,Its demons just want to have a little nasty fun with its human playthings and the gleeful excess is so over-the-top that it leaves the realm of horror and becomes slapstick splatter fest,201
Evil Dead II,"Raimi delivers. At this point, I'm not sure whether he's a genius or certifiable (perhaps a bit of both), but Evil Dead 2 is the horror equivalent of the hardest drugs there are: it bypasses logic and heads straight for your pleasure centers.",201
Evil Dead II,"It revels in bad taste. It boasts smart-alecky special effects. The blood doesn't flow, it gushes. Sitting through this movie is an ordeal. All of which means Evil Dead 2 is a spectacular success. There are horror movies, and then there is this thing.",201
Evil Dead II,"For those who respond by screaming back at the movie while swallowing its junk food aesthetic, this may be the best time they've had in quite a while.",201
Evil Dead II,Keep your eye on Raimi: it's not easy to pitch a comedy at a level this flamboyant and then keep topping the gags.,201
Evil Dead II,"Raimi's style is very reminiscent of his previous collaborations with Joel and Ethan Coen... But while the Coens have found substance to fit their style in Raising Arizona, Raimi is still making glorified splatter movies, however fitfully amusing.",201
Evil Dead II,"I think I could lose my job over this one, but Evil Dead 2 is terrific... It takes the form of the slasher movie and subverts it, suffusing it with comic gusto, bravura filmmaking skills and more sheer originality than any film since Re-Animator.",201
Evil Dead II,"No movie this year has made me laugh half as much as Sam Raimi's whirligig sequel to his cult classic, The Evil Dead.",201
Evil Dead II,"Taken at face value, it's a so-so horror thriller oozing gore. But add a star if you can approach this sequel to The Evil Dead as a decidedly campy follow-up to the original.",201
Groundhog Day,"Chicago connections are many for the Bill Murray classic that’s funny, poignant and way better than sweet vermouth on the rocks, with a twist.",202
Groundhog Day,"As home releases and re-releases start to fall into a bit of an endless cycle, it makes a weird bit of sense that Groundhog Day would lack a certain excitement and feel like more of what we’ve seen, yet still bring about a little bit of joy.",202
Groundhog Day,Nothing suggested that this would gather steam over time and emerge as one of the most respected comedies of the past 30 years.,202
Groundhog Day,"This delightful romantic comedy, directed by Harold Ramis, is rich in fantasy and unexpectedly funny twists.",202
Groundhog Day,Groundhog Day is a Scrooge-like comedy that's surprisingly delightful. It poses a very interesting question: What would happen if every day were the same?,202
Groundhog Day,"There's a purity to Groundhog Day that we rarely see in movies... It's civilized, as well as the perfect entertainment of the moment.",202
Groundhog Day,"This sweetly surrealist comedy is, arguably, Murray's most irresistible effort. Groundhog Day is a warm and rewarding story about reason, reckoning, and romance.",202
Groundhog Day,Director Harold Ramis handles the situation beautifully. A potentially silly premise takes on Capraesque qualities and delights.,202
Groundhog Day,"Groundhog Day could have been a dull one-joke film, but Murray and Ramis make it work by doggedly pursuing the implications of their outlandish premise.",202
Groundhog Day,"This is without doubt the wittiest Bill Murray film ever, filled with verbal, physical and even thematic gags that satisfy on several levels simultaneously.",202
Unforgiven,"It’s stunning cinematography by Jack N. Green is breathtaking, with the brilliant use of wide-shots and placing characters in the foreground in order to capture the epic scale and power of the wide-screen.",203
Unforgiven,A better modern western has yet to be made.,203
Unforgiven,... it finally made official what critics and fans had slowly come to realize over the last decade: Clint Eastwood—legendary as both the iconic western drifter with no name and Dirty Harry—was one of America’s best directors.,203
Unforgiven,David Webb Peoples’ screenplay skillfully balances the seasoned perspective on the ramifications of violence with the compelling journey of a young gunslinger determined to make a name for himself.,203
Unforgiven,"It is arguably his [Eastwood] finest achievement, it is certainly his apex as an actor.",203
Unforgiven,"As great as the script and cinematography are (they are both unassailable), the real magic of Unforgiven is in the performances.",203
Unforgiven,"By embracing the uncertainty behind Munny, the Old West, and American myths, Eastwood elevates a simple story by transcending the genre itself, and transforming his film into great art with the dynamic and compassion that has become his signature.",203
Unforgiven,"An astoundingly powerful tale of a strangely anti-Old West, multilayered outlaw, this film is one of the finest revisionist epics ever brought to the big screen.",203
Unforgiven,Unforgiven thus rejects Eastwood's previous filmography and the patriotic speeches of many other filmmakers involved with the western. [Full Review in Spanish],203
Unforgiven,"Arguably the last of the great movie westerns... The real star of the show here is Gene Hackman, playing the psychotic town sheriff who stands in the way of the trio's bounty.",203
Back to the Future,Robert Zemeckis' rip-roaring sci-fi comedy classic still holds up four decades on from its release and is a fitting reminder of the power of love.,204
Back to the Future,"Strip away the sci-fi, and this trilogy is a tale as old as time. It's a classic hero's journey, the story of someone growing up and discovering where his power really lies.",204
Back to the Future,"The ultimate American summer blockbuster. Incredibly clever, nostalgia-packed, and never gets old. To sum up BTTF in one line: ""Last night Darth Vadar came down from the planet Vulcan and said if I didn't ask Lorraine to the dance, he'd melt my brain!!!""",204
Back to the Future,It remains the best of the series.,204
Back to the Future,Glover's George McFly is the sweetest portrait of teen klutziness ever seen.,204
Back to the Future,"Finally, here it is the first unadulterated pleasure of the summer. Back to the Future is a kick-off-your-shoes, settle-back-in-the-seat movie of abundant humor, boundless energy, and a relentlessly good heart.",204
Back to the Future,What pushes Back to the Future over the edge from so-so to oh-no is its willing complicity in the continuing glorification of the '50s.,204
Back to the Future,Back to the Future is no more than one big joke about going where you don't belong. It has all the substance of junk food and is as harmless as your average TV show.,204
Back to the Future,"Just when it would seem that Steven Spielberg has touched all possible forms of fantasy, he comes up with another one that not only plucks, but plays a complete symphony, on the heartstrings.",204
Back to the Future,"Remember how Huck Finn daydreamed about going to his own funeral? Back to the Future does an inverse, witty turnabout on this theme.",204
Patton,Patton remains one of the great war films for the fact that it can be conceived and both patriotic and anti-war in its delivery.,205
Patton,"It could, of course, be a very smart liberal ploy to make Patton a monster-man among mice, but it backfires by turning him into a hero.",205
Patton,Patton is one of the most brilliant one-man film shows ever produced.,205
Patton,One of the greatest war movies ever made.,205
Patton,"If he were to return in a Hollywood guise, Patton would just have to come back as George C. Scott. For Scott is Patton incarnate in a superb acting performance that rescues the film from some of Schaffner's more pedestrian directing devices.",205
Patton,"True, we learn to hate Patton's guts, but we also learn to understand the pragmatic magnetism that caused his men to follow him anywhere.",205
Patton,"Naturally... we see all sides of Patton, but are exposed only to the more shallow surfaces of the other characters.",205
Patton,George C. Scott makes for such an unstoppably watchable Patton that... he makes every single onscreen moment feels like the most vital thing you have ever seen in a movie.,205
Patton,"I'd like to pin four stars on each shoulder of George C. Scott for his perspective characterization of the military genius, the controversial man.",205
Patton,"The movie's vision blurs the man and, incidentally, the just war around him.",205
Akira,Akira is one of the great anime sci-fi classics and has been influential across various forms of media.,206
Akira,"Great to look at, but more exhausting than entertaining.",206
Akira,Such an extraordinary achievement demands to be seen and seen again for re-evaluation into its deeper relevance—and to be appreciated as a landmark not just of anime but of international cinema.,206
Akira,"AKIRA is an audiovisual masterpiece that still blows me away after all these years. For two hours, the film takes us into a completely disrupted world in which destruction and ambivalence are omnipresent. A film you will never forget.",206
Akira,"The opening motorbike chase is still thrilling, but the dedication to the backgrounds as well as crowds of people filling the screen, explosions happening in the distance, and a jaw-dropping sense of scope make Akira the classic that it is.",206
Akira,Akira's strangeness is very startling and sometimes bewildering. But there is a thanatonic rapture to its vision of a whole world ending and being reborn as something else.,206
Akira,"I've seen the movie four times, and this go-around my jaw was lower on the floor than ever before, somehow.",206
Akira,"It's dark and violent but, because it is so creative, it is a really fun experience. It's like Inception but way more trippy!",206
Akira,"It continues to show the best of the genre, almost 30 years later. It would be sacrilegious to give a different rating from PERFECT to AKIRA. [Full review in Spanish]",206
Akira,"Handsome and preposterously ambitious, and even its worst narrative missteps are a factor of that ambition.",206
Cyrano de Bergerac,The result is a nosier Depardieu without loosing sex appeal. [Full review in Spanish],207
Cyrano de Bergerac,"Directed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau in French and based on the 1897 play of the same name by Edmond Rostand, this is comedy-tragedy in the grand style, with sets, costumes and battles to match the rich verse and tormented emotion.",207
Cyrano de Bergerac,Gerard Depardieu gives a tour de force Oscar-nominated performance in this sumptuous (and best) screen version of the famous play,207
Cyrano de Bergerac,More artistry and energy than virtually any American costume drama from that period you could name.,207
Cyrano de Bergerac,The great thing about Jean-Paul Rappeneau's 1990 film -- apart from Gerard Depardieu's central performance -- is that it returns the play to its popular entertainment self.,207
Cyrano de Bergerac,[T]here's a kind of soaring beauty to this expansively passionate film...,207
Cyrano de Bergerac,"There are better love stories, but Cyrano is arguably the ultimate celebration of the romantic spirit… Depardieu makes the part forever his own.",207
Cyrano de Bergerac,"From the opening scene in which he takes on a theater full of pretentious actors to the grand tearjerking finale, Cyrano is always the center of attention, and Depardieu, full of wit, bravado and passion, rises to the challenge.",207
Cyrano de Bergerac,"Gives romantic love a good name, thanks to the flamboyant performance of Gerard Depardieu in this classic.",207
Cyrano de Bergerac,The result is a nosier Depardieu without loosing sex appeal. [Full review in Spanish],207
Young Frankenstein,The best Mel Brooks film with the finest Gene Wilder performance is this near-flawless horror spoof that’s shot in velvety monochrome and pays loving homage to the original Universal monster movies of the 1930s.,208
Young Frankenstein,"In some ways it can now be considered not as satire or spoof, but a continuation of the Frankenstein genre, a connoisseur development or theme-variation not so far removed from the Hammer or Warhol riffs.",208
Young Frankenstein,"Mel Brooks’ best film -- indeed, it’s one of the greatest comedies ever made.",208
Young Frankenstein,"Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder create something that has never been repeated in the legion of movie spoofs that followed: a real movie with dynamic characters, a story that stands on its own, and a touching undercurrent of pathos amidst the parody.",208
Young Frankenstein,Mr. Brooks has combined the zaniness of Blazing Saddles with the structure of Producers and has come up with a very funny movie.,208
Young Frankenstein,"This black-and-white parody of the Karloff classic is the most cinematically assured, coherent and (relatively speaking) tasteful of Brooks's films.",208
Young Frankenstein,It is a comedy in which Brooks takes some creative liberties when it comes to addressing Shelley's work and uses Frankenstein's monster to parody Universal's horror movies with a hilarious and quite entertaining tone. [Full review in Spanish],208
Young Frankenstein,"Its got wit, its got silliness, and it's chock full of one-liners, all made with love from Brooks. Young Frankenstein feels like a worthy homage.",208
Young Frankenstein,"Though it's fueled by memorable moments of dippy lampooning, it also carries on a touch too long; it's quite funny but ultimately not as polished as it could be.",208
Young Frankenstein,They don't do comedies like this anymore. Gene Wilder's performance is one for the ages. [Full review in Spanish],208
This Is Spinal Tap,This brilliantly crafted and completely on-target satire of the rock 'n' roll industry is filmed in mock documentary style.,209
This Is Spinal Tap,"This now stands as one of the premier cult movies of all time, an honor no one saw coming back in ’84.",209
This Is Spinal Tap,Rob Reiner’s mockumentary deserves plaudits for the British accents alone.,209
This Is Spinal Tap,The hilariousness here is unending.,209
This Is Spinal Tap,Little riffs of comic genius can be heard amidst the heavy-metal cacophony of This is Spinal Tap...,209
This Is Spinal Tap,"Documenting the licks and antics of a real band is one thing. Building a movie around a fake one is a challenge of a different order. The key, as Spinal Tap proved, is to fabricate a band that looks, acts and sounds at least as good as the real thing.",209
This Is Spinal Tap,"This is Spinal Tap is hilarious to everyone who's not a musician. Because as ridiculous and perverse as Rob Reiner's heavy metal mockumentary gets, the slim, 82-minute comedy gnaws at more truths than any other rock 'n' roll biopic put to celluloid.",209
This Is Spinal Tap,"Reiner, with McKean, Guest and Harry Shearer, have done a great job in creating and portraying characters that are dimwitted, cliched and yet oddly endearing.",209
This Is Spinal Tap,"Yes Nigel, you did go to 11. Where would cinematic comedy be if you hadn't?",209
This Is Spinal Tap,"Consistently funny, with sheer brilliant turns from every performer on the cast...",209
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade closed the decade in style.,210
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"An awfully good and deliciously watchable popcorn movie, made by probably the single most reliable director of popcorn movies in the history of American cinema, when he was still pretty close to the peak of his powers.",210
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"While the first instalment is a visceral and unexpectedly violent adventure, ""The Last Crusade"" is a gentler experience, more concerned with softening Indy's character through his relationship with his father. Full review in Spanish.",210
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"[It's] a rip-snorting, action-packed adventure. It is fun. It is exhilarating. It has all the elements you want -- the hero, the trustworthy friends, the villains, the father's love, the damsel, the action, the cliffhangers, the prize.",210
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"As I watched it, I felt a real delight, because recent Hollywood escapist movies have become too jaded and cynical, and they have lost the feeling that you can stumble over astounding adventures just by going on a hike with your Scout troop.",210
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"If Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were never born, the world would be a little less exciting.",210
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"Of the three Jones films, The Last Crusade may well become the sentimental favorite, the Indiana to end them all.",210
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,All concerned say that this is the end of Indiana Jones the end the series that began with Raiders of the Lost Ark. I'm not buying it. This thing looks as if it was almost as much fun to make as it was arduous.,210
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"It's impossible to recapture the joy and wonder of seeing a superlative picture like Raiders for the first time, but to his credit Spielberg comes very close.",210
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"River Phoenix, meanwhile, has a few marvelous moments as the adolescent Indiana Jones in the film's fabulous 16-minute prologue.",210
M*A*S*H,"It was the right picture at the right time, a commentary on the madness of war, set in Korea but clearly seen by audiences as a stand-in for Vietnam, featuring characters who don’t just defy authority but flaunted their insubordination.",211
M*A*S*H,... Riotously funny and rather bleak.,211
M*A*S*H,At best it’s a snapshot of where young America’s heads were at back then.,211
M*A*S*H,"Altman's original movie revels in misogyny, racism, prankster humour and very outdated attitudes; it really should not be watchable in 2021, but it is...",211
M*A*S*H,"When it comes to absurdist, black-humor antiwar films, M.A.S.H. falls way, way behind Catch-22.",211
M*A*S*H,One of my comfortable films because it reminds me in the most subtle of ways that when I am in the midst of the battle there is always a way to survive.,211
M*A*S*H,"A wholly unique comedy, oriented in a most unlikely setting.",211
M*A*S*H,"It is ribald, cruel, sick, sacrilegious, offensive and enormously funny, continuously and wildly hilarious.",211
M*A*S*H,A good (but not great) comedy about the calculated idiocies of war precisely because it is a human and ultimately humane movie.,211
M*A*S*H,"M*A*S*H is a comedy of military humor, with a tear here and there, plenty of gags, and fun dialogue. [Full Review in Spanish]",211
"Unbearable Lightness of Being, The","It's an uncommonly mature, literate work, and one that embraces the erotic openly and without apprehension.",212
"Unbearable Lightness of Being, The","I didn't remember anything of the Milan Kundera novel. But as the movie started I knew just what was coming next and I loved seeing it happen -- it was like a dream that you long to return to, and lo! there it is.",212
"Unbearable Lightness of Being, The","…one of the great narratives about life, fate, poetry and fatality…",212
"Unbearable Lightness of Being, The",The film is like a sonata in four seasons. [Full review in Spanish],212
"Unbearable Lightness of Being, The","The actors are in top form, remaining authentic to their roles throughout, convincing predominantly through expressions and actions since the dialogue is unusually minimal.",212
"Unbearable Lightness of Being, The",An excellent movie. [Full Review in Spanish],212
"Unbearable Lightness of Being, The","The Unbearable Lightness of Being is an ambitious, even reverential adaptation of Milan Kundera's brilliant novel of love and ideas. And there you have the problem.",212
"Unbearable Lightness of Being, The",This lengthy movie doesn't add up to much.,212
"Unbearable Lightness of Being, The",Some wonderful atmospherics of a besieged culture.,212
"Unbearable Lightness of Being, The","Engaging, well-acted, often lyrical rendition of Milan Kundera's famous novel, Philip Kaufman's film contains some of the most erotic scenes to be in seen in an American picture",212
"Room with a View, A","The performances -- particularly by Maggie Smith, Helena Bonham Carter and Denholm Elliot -- are superbly wrought in this tale of conflicting cultures, embattled sexes and changing values.",213
"Room with a View, A","The beauty of the Italian and English countrysides, the acting of Maggie Smith and Denholm Elliott and the immediacy of a particularly brutal killing all combine to make this one of the most visually affecting films you'll see all year.",213
"Room with a View, A","Adapted by Merchant Ivory from EM Forster’s novel, this is a lush wallow in nostalgic romanticism.",213
"Room with a View, A",A Room With a View is an outstanding period piece. It captures Forster's characters in their milieu with a temperament that effectively stirs modern-day sensitivities.,213
"Room with a View, A",The simple story is embroidered with delightful dialogue and rare characterizations.,213
"Room with a View, A",Episode 11: Moving On,213
"Room with a View, A","""A Room With a View"" is an artistically told tale of a Victorian-era ""Little-Miss-Can't-Be-Wrong"" learning to follow her heart and live her bliss.",213
"Room with a View, A","As in all Ivory films, the movie has a delightful pace, as if the director were enjoying himself so much that he wanted to take maximum care with each frame of celluloid so that his audience could share his pleasure.",213
"Room with a View, A","If amusing, ""A Room With a View"" is little more than a lark, a series of skits, a two-hour tribute to the rich British eccentric.",213
"Room with a View, A","The film's charms are many but they are not the sort that resonate with any aspect of human behaviour with which I am familiar. When you get this English, or this Edwardian, or, rather, late Victorian, really, it's like science fiction, I suppose.",213
Pink Floyd - The Wall,"The scenes of violence are marvelously put together. It is hard to realize that we are watching fiction... However, although The Wall is horrifying, it is not lurid; we are never allowed to derive from this film any satisfaction for our kinkiness.",214
Pink Floyd - The Wall,Not for everyone.,214
Pink Floyd - The Wall,What is the price of fame and is it vicariously experienced in concert with the successful or is it in the foundational underpinnings of a life lived in turmoil. Pink Floyd The Wall attempts to examine this unusual notion in cinematic form.,214
Pink Floyd - The Wall,"As all operas should be, the film is high drama and folds in trippy animation, war flashbacks, gory sequences, and giants sets to tell its tale.",214
Pink Floyd - The Wall,Psych 101 on an epic scale.,214
Pink Floyd - The Wall,"Alan Parker has created a world of his own. It is unfortunate, however, that there isn't a consistent reflection behind it. [Full Review in Spanish]",214
Pink Floyd - The Wall,"This isn't the most fun to listen to and some viewers don't find it to much fun to watch, but the 1982 film is without question the best of all serious fiction films devoted to rock.",214
Pink Floyd - The Wall,"It's a pretty grim portrait, but even worse it is often repetitive and boring. There are probably enough powerful segments for half a dozen or so outstanding rock videos but not a full-length feature.",214
Pink Floyd - The Wall,"One of the more exceptional, unprecedented films to ever come from Great Britain, a guttural howl of rage at the darkest aspects of English culture.",214
Pink Floyd - The Wall,"The film is explosively wild, raw, primitive, sometimes inarticulate. It is also totally theatrical and compelling. It's film as primal scream; seething with anger, alienation and despair.",214
Field of Dreams,"The end result may be highly unusual and untraditionally un-cinematic, but it’s nevertheless sweet and touching, embellished with moments of effective humor and stirring sentimentality.",215
Field of Dreams,"A wonderful, sentimental tribute to father-son relationships everywhere and the lovely game of baseball. A sports classic. [Full review in Spanish]",215
Field of Dreams,The maximum pleasure offered here is seeing how far the delirium of the original book can reach... winning my admiration. [Full review in Spanish],215
Field of Dreams,"Situated somewhere between third base and The Twilight Zone, ""Field of Dreams"" is a modern-day fairy tale about a noble quest for a grand design.",215
Field of Dreams,...a deliberately-paced yet progressively absorbing drama...,215
Field of Dreams,"""Field of Dreams"" resonated so powerfully with people wishing for a return to traditional values, plus confirmation that parallel dimensions, karma, and clairvoyance exist, that the actual movie-set field in Iowa became a major tourist attraction.",215
Field of Dreams,Field of Dreams is baseball perfection.,215
Field of Dreams,"This is a story about passion, not just for baseball, but also a passion to do something with our one precious life even if people think it's crazy.",215
Field of Dreams,It's hard to imagine a cynicism so hardened that it won't crumble at the sight of a lush green baseball field nestled into an Iowa cornfield and at this movie's final inspiring scene of youth and innocence recaptured.,215
Field of Dreams,"In Costner, writer-director Robinson has found the perfect player for a personal-stakes game, a guy with a leg-it-out intensity and kidlike enthusiasm. It's Costner's eye-on-the-ball exuberance that carries Dreams past its often mechanical aesthetic.",215
When Harry Met Sally...,"It’s a perfect movie, the pinnacle of Meg Ryan’s career, and the only thing I think about when thinking about Billy Crystal.",216
When Harry Met Sally...,"Enhanced by a dreamy mood and a quintessentially American score, When Harry Met Sally has some deft, witty observations about the nature of male-female relationships in our time.",216
When Harry Met Sally...,"Rob Reiner's direction is feather-light, precisely paced and with fine appreciation of the sharp New Yorkisms of the dialogue.",216
When Harry Met Sally...,"Reiner seems to share his characters’ narcissism. Or at least, like Harry, he tends to shy from troublesome emotions.",216
When Harry Met Sally...,"Reiner and Ephron deftly thread Casablanca through Harry and Sally's on-again, off-again relationship.",216
When Harry Met Sally...,Anyone with even the vaguest knowledge of everything Reiner and Ephron have done thus far knows that When Harry Met Sally is their baby all the way -- wall-eyed sentimental ending and all.,216
When Harry Met Sally...,"Despite a troubling superficiality, When Harry met Sally... delivers something rare for a summer movie -- a bright, intelligent, timely and funny comedy of adult manners.",216
When Harry Met Sally...,"When Harry Met Sally... excels in its dead-on representation of gentle, intimate, everyday truths.",216
When Harry Met Sally...,Such culturally deft variations on familiar themes help make Harry Met Sally more substantial -- and enjoyable -- than the basic witty romance that it might have become.,216
When Harry Met Sally...,When Harry Met Sally... is pure movie magic.,216
Bram Stoker's Dracula,"Like the powers of the mythical creatures, the film occasionally ignores logic, instead emphasizing emotion and the instinctual impressions that the stunning visuals bring out in the audience. It’s impossible not to give in to its charms.",217
Bram Stoker's Dracula,"As the tired count who has overdosed on immortality, Gary Oldman's towering performance holds centre stage and burns itself into the memory.",217
Bram Stoker's Dracula,"This film is an absolute work of art. From the production design to the costumes, this is a perfectly grand and lavish adaptation of the original story that captures the tragedy in this narrative so well!",217
Bram Stoker's Dracula,"Opulent and lustrous, it never makes much sense at the character level, but glistens with such dark, carbuncular magnificence and is fueled by such an elixir of sexual yearning that I defy any manjack among you to deny its murky tidal pull.",217
Bram Stoker's Dracula,"This Dracula is only eyeball-deep, a series of opulent sensory jolts, drained of real emotion; in effect, it's a two-hour trailer for a film that never arrives.",217
Bram Stoker's Dracula,"It's a major misstep for Coppola, who has lavished attention on an artsy presentational style but ignored the film's dramatic needs. This Dracula tries to be romantic and ends up being merely insipid.",217
Bram Stoker's Dracula,The movie seethes with visual genius and imagistic segues so brazenly hokey that to call them kitsch would utterly trivialize the hallucinatory onslaught. The naive bravado of it all ravishes sense and subtlety.,217
Bram Stoker's Dracula,"The film's weakest link is James V. Hart's bloated octopus of a screenplay. On all other counts, this Dracula achieves the near-impossible: It brings fresh imagery and new blood to a cinematic vein that had grown anemic and derivative in recent years.",217
Bram Stoker's Dracula,"Performances come second in such a tech's dream, of course, but Oldman is a splendid Dracula, cackling and howling and thoroughly enjoying himself, and Hopkins is a great Van Helsing for the same reasons.",217
Bram Stoker's Dracula,"No matter what else you do with it, a Dracula that cannot manage to be more scary than silly is as pitilessly doomed as that elegant old Transylvanian himself.",217
Cape Fear,Yet the grubby story is elevated by a superior cast in both the original and this grimly bloodthirsty remake.,218
Cape Fear,The picture's missteps are more than numerous.,218
Cape Fear,Ever shot reminds you that a consummate artist is having a great time remaking a kinky minor classic.,218
Cape Fear,"Everything is relatively dirty, and no one is truly good, except for this film, it's phenomenal. [Full review in Spanish]",218
Cape Fear,"(De Niro) had played a tough guy before, but never quite like this: a very sinister, very jagged, very dangerous character… put that together with Martin Scorsese at possibly the peak of his powers, and it’s a delightful if slightly scary film.",218
Cape Fear,"Martin Scorsese wasn't supposed to remake the 1962 thriller, but when he did, he brought along his longtime muse and infused the story with an overwhelming amount of trademark chaos...",218
Cape Fear,"It's a mess, really. But what a mess! Why do we call Scorsese one of the great filmmakers of his generation? Because, like all the great ones, even when he fails he fails with style and with wit.",218
Cape Fear,...an exceedingly pulpy and over-the-top thriller that's been suffused with a whole host of appealingly less-than-subtle elements...,218
Cape Fear,Scorsese/De Niro revenge thriller has sexual violence.,218
Cape Fear,"The wrath of De Niro, especially when pitched to the level of a jangle-brained Jehovah, is a mighty thing, but, in this case, its inherent cartoonery capsizes this film's small-story frame.",218
"Nightmare on Elm Street, A","Wes Craven's 1984 slasher classic has been spoofed, repackaged, and plagiarized to death, but the original Nightmare still stands out.",219
"Nightmare on Elm Street, A",Craven's low budget masterpiece benefits from a whip-smart screenplay and a career-defining performance from Robert Englund.,219
"Nightmare on Elm Street, A",A Nightmare on Elm Street overcame significant financial challenges and wound up introducing two iconic horror characters and innumerable set pieces that define the genre. The film is nothing less than a masterpiece.,219
"Nightmare on Elm Street, A","Right out of the gate, it’s clear why 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is on the Mount Rushmore of slashers. It expertly shapes a candy bowl’s worth of suspense, providing a chilling introduction to its iconic villain.",219
"Nightmare on Elm Street, A",Wes Craven’s imperfect but entertaining horror that still has considerable black-comic energy.,219
"Nightmare on Elm Street, A","Contrary to popular belief, it wasn’t considered an instant classic by anyone upon its original release. There was a reason for its middling response.",219
"Nightmare on Elm Street, A","Wes Craven, known as the master of horror and sultan of shock, brings terrifying thrills in A Nightmare On Elm Street, a true classic of the genre.",219
"Nightmare on Elm Street, A",Craven employs some startling horror setups and knows how to make his audience jump,219
"Nightmare on Elm Street, A",Craven treats us to a garish visual trip into the dark side of dreamland.,219
"Nightmare on Elm Street, A",There is something chilling about being haunted through your dreams- a space you have no control of and can only put off for so long.,219
"Mirror Has Two Faces, The",...but it’s an engaging and entertaining film that ultimately alters our expectations of Streisand as an actor and as a director.,220
"Mirror Has Two Faces, The",The film is obsessed with the notion of prettiness but never says anything insightful about it.,220
"Mirror Has Two Faces, The","Oh Barbra, Barbra, Diva mine! Couldn't you find a project more worthy of your prodigious talents?",220
"Mirror Has Two Faces, The",The loopy contrivance of this plot is exacerbated by the broadness with which Streisand directs Richard LaGravenese's script. The slapstick manner collides queasily with the therapeutic tone.,220
"Mirror Has Two Faces, The","[Barbara] Streisand's direction is solid, save for a needless run-on ending over the final credits, and cinematographers Dante Spinotti and Andrzej Bartkowiak make New York City sparkle.",220
"Mirror Has Two Faces, The","A terrific, thought provoking, at times heart wrenching twist on the typical rom-com proving again Streisands singular gifts.",220
"Mirror Has Two Faces, The",Princess of Tides,220
"Mirror Has Two Faces, The","Downer story does match its book source, for the most part. Great cast.",220
"Mirror Has Two Faces, The","I didn't wanna like it. But by movie's end, I didn't hate it. Points for that.",220
"Mirror Has Two Faces, The",A uniquely awful vanity piece.,220
Breaking the Waves,"Breaking the Waves is hardly an easy watch. But, it’s a powerful film which stays with you long after it has finished. I never quite know what I am going to get with a Lars von Trier film, and there’s something so exciting about that.",221
Breaking the Waves,"[An] earnest, yet harrowing, heartbreaker...",221
Breaking the Waves,"Von Trier’s patent insincerity and facetiousness could be read as a satire on movie emotionalism, or as its own kind of conceptual art. Either way, it’s quite an experience.",221
Breaking the Waves,"There may be no way to prepare for the shock of Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves, a film that accumulates moral momentum as it rolls on and bears down on you in its last half hour like a lightning strike.",221
Breaking the Waves,"Emily Watson gives this musty spiritualism a flesh and-blood sympathetic center. Her purity of emotion, be it bliss, fear or sorrow, are convincingly unactorly and the camera -- even Von Trier's handheld pseudo-documentary one -- loves her face.",221
Breaking the Waves,"There are few movies around that take such huge risks: this is high-wire filmmaking, without a net of irony.",221
Breaking the Waves,"Gloomy '90s drama has cursing, nudity, mature themes.",221
Breaking the Waves,Both a ferocious love story and a tale of the triumph of vital individual faith over ossified and corrupt organized religion.,221
Breaking the Waves,"Issues of faith, devotion, sexuality and divine intervention are at the center of this daring and provocative piece that placed writer-director Lars von Trier on the international map.",221
Breaking the Waves,"It's a testament to Emily Watson's astounding performance as Bess that she comes across as more than a von Trier construct; she's a woman of boundless passion, who follows her faith wherever it takes her.",221
Star Trek: First Contact,"Star Trek: First Contact is not merely a great Star Trek film. This is a great film, period.",222

Star Trek: First Contact,Star Trek fans will find that same style and unique form of storytelling that they’ve come to expect from the franchise.,222
Star Trek: First Contact,"If you've never watched anything Star Trek before, First Contact is a very accessible film and highly recommended.",222
Star Trek: First Contact,"The best cinematic outing featuring the Next Generation cast, one that found a great story to tell featuring the Borg, one of the franchise's greatest antagonists. (25th anniversary)",222
Star Trek: First Contact,This is why we go to Star Trek: for a tomorrow of promise and possibility and stories that lift us from the muck of what we are to the summit of what we might learn to be.,222

Sling Blade,"Stretched over 141 minutes, and threaded with humor, it is remarkably spare and simple, a slow movie about a slow man-Forrest Gump Unplugged.",223
Sling Blade,Much of the audience appeal relies on the film's simplicity,223
Sling Blade,"Marking Billy Bob Thornton's debut as a director and solo writer, Sling Blade is a powerful southern gothic parable about good and evil.",223
Sling Blade,"Well acted, a multi-leveled story and a pure honesty make Sling Blade one of my favourite films of the 1990s.",223
Sling Blade,"Thornton brings three key ingredients to the table: distinctive, rich, authentic Southern locations, patient and painterly atmosphere, and a precise and fresh character to study. [Blu-ray]",223

101 Dalmatians,"Brilliant puppy wrangling, seamlessly blended with special effects, and a witty and sophisticated performance by Glenn Close as dazzlingly costumed Cruella DeVil more than compensate for spottier moments.",225
101 Dalmatians,"While the adorableness quotient of the new ""101"" is never in doubt, fans of the original may feel that its wit and charm have been diminished...Cute and broad, this re-make's OK. What I miss--what I'd hoped for--was a tad more sophistication.",225
101 Dalmatians,"[Glenn] Close creates an iconic, comically menacing character that lingers in the memory long after the bland nonsense of the film has faded.",225

101 Dalmatians,"...an entertaining, surprisingly charming update of the Disney's 1961 animated classic.",225
101 Dalmatians,as good of a live-action Cruella as we could expect,225
101 Dalmatians,"To find the biggest source of problems with this remake, take a look at the producer's name. 101 Dalmatians is Disney's first joint venture with John Hughes,",225
101 Dalmatians,"Glenn Close is easily the most notable element of the production, looking the part about as ideally as imaginable.",225
101 Dalmatians,"Brilliant puppy wrangling, seamlessly blended with special effects, and a witty and sophisticated performance by Glenn Close as dazzlingly costumed Cruella DeVil more than compensate for spottier moments.",225
Die Hard 2,"In every way that Die Hard was original and something new, Die Hard 2 fails to honor that by resigning to more of the same.",226
Die Hard 2,"It’s a solid sequel, bigger in spectacle but not the equal of the first film.",226
Die Hard 2,"Plays it very safe with the plot by copying a lot of what made the first work but sadly the villains of the piece are far, far less interesting. It does have some fun scenes and Bruce Willis is still on fine form so still worth a watch though...",226
Die Hard 2,Die Hard 2 is ubiquitous and sensationally entertaining. [Full review in Spanish],226
Die Hard 2,"Packs plenty of punch, heavy-hitting adventure, and explosions galore.",226
Die Hard 2,"The filmmakers know the audience is challenging them to top themselves, and they've risen to the bait. Harlin and company build suspense the old-fashioned way. They earn it.",226
Die Hard 2,"In a summer of wildly violent action films, 'Die Hard 2' stands out. It is the best action movie since 'Lethal Weapon II,' as vastly entertaining, exciting and improbable.",226
Die Hard 2,"This is the most cheerfully preposterous film of a jaw-dropping summer, which is not to say it's not fun, it's simply orchestrated Looney Tunes.",226
Die Hard 2,"Even in the action genre, there is such a thing as overkill. Die Hard 2: Die Harder pleads guilty to the charge but has enough redeeming plot twists to compensate for the excess.",226
Die Hard 2,The summer's best sequel and most satisfying blockbuster has finally arrived. Die Hard 2 is a blast.,226
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,"That the film is among the best acted and directed of all Star Trek films and remains fully entertaining throughout its reflection on the past, its present-day self-exploration, and its consideration of the future, confirms its triumph.",227
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,"Everything here -- directing, acting, writing and visual effects -- is conventional but fine. It's an honorable and good-humored conclusion to this part of the Star Trek saga, as we await the next generation.",227
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,An exciting entry.,227
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,Has returned the candor without pretensions of the television show's cheap start. [Full review in Spanish],227
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,"It may not be overly exciting, but at least it doesn't poke fun at itself ... too much.",227
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,"An affecting farewell to the original Enterprise crew and a welcome return to form after the disappointing fifth film, The Undiscovered Country is as fun and creative as it is dramatically compelling.",227
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,Leave it to Capt. James T. Kirk and his intrepid crew to end the Star Trek series at warp speed. Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is one of the finest installments in the saga.,227
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,"It's at once gripping, humorous, emotional, and immensely satisfying. An appropriate and fitting farewell to the finest crew in the fleet.",227
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,"I hate to sound like a populist, but Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is the most enjoyable film I have seen this year.",227
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,"Star Trek VI goes nowhere. Through all its Confucian sayings, its United States-Soviet Union metaphor and its Shakespeare samplings, it tries to be sophisticated and witty but only achieves talkiness.",227
Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,"Using the contrast between Ricardo Montalban’s fiery Khan and William Shatner’s pasty Captain Kirk as the psychological center, [director Nicholas Meyer] keeps the movie whipping from one incident to another.",228
Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,"The Wrath of Khan does something that movies based on television shows have tried to do, but have often failed to accomplish: the film elevates the material from TV to film with appropriate gravitas.",228
Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,Entertaining and charming in its innocent idealism.,228
Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,"The emotive finale... smartly restates the film’s themes of ageing and mortality, and provides cinema history with the unforgettable, tear-jerking line: “I have been, and always shall be, your friend.”",228
Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,The movie that may very well have saved the Trek franchise (40th anniversary),228
Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,It’s Montalbahn’s physical threat and very real sense of menace that gives Wrath of Khan its propulsive narrative and addictive quality that keeps you coming back time and again.,228
Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,"The dull thud of Nicholas Mayer's direction, which mixes the custardy platitudes of the original television series with some of the less-thunderous special effects of the latter-day cinema, has everything in place, like a tidy housewife's kitchen.",228
Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,Fans of the Starship Enterprise will be ecstatic while others will find in this production a certain sluggish pace amid rather fine special effects.,228
Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,"In the end, it makes for a beautiful summary, an envoi from which one can circle back through the re-runs and consider Star Trek as a finished whole. Even if they never make another, the saga can stand complete.",228
Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,"Star Trek II tells a sock-'em story, which is more than can be said for the first Star Trek movie. Nicholas Meyer, an energetic director, is a master of narrative, and Star Trek II crackles with his wit.",228
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,"You will have to disregard the fact that Kirk and a handful of intimates manage to pilot the Enterprise on their own. But this episode is written and performed with muscular vigour and attack, and there are some nice moments.",229
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,"Flaws aside, The Search for Spock is pleasant, character-driven entertainment.",229
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,"Not as iconic as The Wrath of Khan, this is still one of the better original Trek film, which stays close to the series original purpose.",229
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,Leaves a lot to be desired and becomes pretentious.,229
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,"For all it does right, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock doesn't represent the series at its best.",229
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,Despite the grim goings-on there is still a sense of humour and fun scattered thoughout.,229
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,"The sci-fi themes are just as esoteric as before (and fitting for the universe), but the sense of adventure has vanished.",229
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,Star Trek III: The Search for Spock is much better than its reputation would lead you to believe.,229
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,"An uneven and at times quite ridiculous follow-up to The Wrath of Khan, but still worthwhile thanks to solid performances and great character work.",229
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,Star Trek III does what it needs to do by restoring part of the original status quo and setting up a new one to be resolved at a later date.,229
Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home may be the most important film within the franchise, as it demonstrates how the potential of its venerable characters transcends space and time.",230
Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,"Offered quite a bit more levity than the previous films- or at least, as much as is possible for a movie that features the possible end of life on Earth.",230
Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,The comedy in this entry is so broad that the movie often doesn't even feel like a Star Trek project (which of course explains its wide popularity).,230
Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,Much of the fun to be found in the quite witty screenplay involves the bemused citizens of the future trying to cope with 20th-century life.,230
Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,"Time travel is a new concept for this series, and having the crew visit a familiar version of Earth is certainly an amusing idea; but why did it have to involve whales?",230
Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,"As much a passionate, heavy-handed environmental screed as it is a flighty space opera, The Voyage Home can't ever quite reconcile its disparate moods and ideas into a holistic experience.",230
Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,"The marching orders here were for a romp, and a romp they produced.",230
Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,"If most movies today are doomed to be sure-fire, presold properties--with ideas leached from our recent TV or cinematic past--let's hope they're all as good at the game as ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.""",230
Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,"A bit flimsy to be legitimately counted as ""great"" Star Trek, but aware enough of its characters and their attachments to each other and the audience that it's ""fun"" Star Trek.",230
Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,"Buoyant, farcical time-travel Enterprise escapade.",230
Batman Returns,"Batman Returns transcends its genre and shines its Bat-Signal on our foibles and neuroses, conveying a collective humanity with neither heroism nor villainy, just a long, slow trip into the dark.",231
Batman Returns,"Ah, remember when superhero movies used to be weird? [...] Returns on its own is a fascinating beast, a movie following iconic characters that have been interpreted and reinterpreted throughout the years. Yet, it’s a movie only Burton could have made.",231
Batman Returns,"Although Batman Returns is tonally lighter than its predecessor, the film nevertheless exists in the shadows. It’s also weirder, an indication of Burton exerting stronger creative control.",231
Batman Returns,"It’s everything you’d want a Burton Batman movie to be, complete with some incredible set designs and yet another banger of a score from Elfman.",231
Batman Returns,"What makes a good superhero story is a villain, and they both played their parts so well.",231
Batman Returns,"More than the character or the love people have for him, it is about the unique vision that it fully executes. Batman Returns is a Burton movie just as much as it is one about The Caped Crusader.",231
Batman Returns,"'Batman Returns' is undeniably a Christmas movie. With the Scrooge-like Max Shreck and a sewer-dwelling penguin person, the Gotham created by Burton and co. is cartoonishly bleak.",231
Batman Returns,"As always, the story is a clothesline for grand, lavish images. The surprise here is that they’re darker, more painfully felt.",231
Batman Returns,"I always considered it ""dark,"" but compared to takes on Batman brought out in the subsequent years by the likes of Christopher Nolan, Zack Snyder, and Matt Reeves, Burton’s version was practically sunshine and comedy. (30th anniversrary)",231
Batman Returns,The grotesque style of Burton + DeVito's 100% commitment to the Penguin make me not able to look away.,231
Young Guns,"To my surprise, there’s a movie here that features a fair amount of grit.",232
Young Guns,Too much pretty-boy posturing by several of its Brat Pack stars.,232
Young Guns,... If you don’t take it too seriously it’s an entertaining romp.,232
Young Guns,A grownup could die in this wasteland.,232
Young Guns,"''Young Guns'' is a very Dean-ish, sensitive delinquent melodrama disguised, for no good reason, as a western.",232
Young Guns,"The polite word for his kind of filmmaking is ""classical.'' Another word is ""trite.""",232
Young Guns,It's a western that shows both box-office calculation and respect for American history.,232
Young Guns,There's some tough action sequences and a personable cast - including cameos from Tom Cruise and Brooke Shields - in a movie that (almost) kick-started a fading genre.,232
Young Guns,Yet the story is told with too much affection for gunplay and the only thought worth preserving is that these mythic figures of the Old West often were very young men. Big deal.,232
Young Guns,"It's glossy, slick and stylish, but boasts very little in the way of substance or excitement.",232
Under Siege,"Seagal may lack natural charisma, but a flamboyant performance from Jones, plus some sterling work from fellow baddies Gary Busey and Colm Meaney, more than compensate for his deficiencies.",233
Under Siege,"If you only see one Steven Seagal movie (and you really don't even need to see one), be sure it's this one.",233
Under Siege,...a seriously appealing premise that's employed to distressingly erratic effect by Davis...,233
Under Siege,"Die Hard on a ship, this Steven Seagal starrer is a hard-charged, perfectly detonated actioner that should especially delight especially macho mainstreamers.",233
Under Siege,"The story, ridiculous and formulaic though it is, is told with a certain wit and panache.",233
Under Siege,"The tension and humor level tail off a bit toward the conclusion, but Steven Seagal and Chicago director Andy Davis clearly declare themselves as top-flight talent.",233
Under Siege,"Slick, old-fashioned formulaic entertainment",233
Under Siege,"Seagal, it turns out, is only as good as his director.",233
Under Siege,"I'm not sure the wife or girlfriend would approve, but for the man of the house, it's above-average beer-and-pretzels material.",233
Under Siege,Steven Seagals' finest moment....action from go to whoa,233
Jaws,Infinitely watchable...,234
Jaws,"It’s a scrappy film that moves with complete and utter confidence, creating as much tension with all you don’t see as it does with what you do.",234
Jaws,"It is a thriller, according to the classic distinction, of surprise rather than suspense. You feel like a rat, being given shock treatment, who has not yet figured out what to do to call off the buzzers.",234
Jaws,"Spielberg touches that central mystery that has always drawn men to the last earthly frontier: the image of an unfathomable, impenetrable deep full of terror beyond our reckoning.",234
Jaws,The film's punch doesn't rely on unmitigated gore. Spielberg is inclined to tease us with false alarms so that the real thing explodes with heart-stopping shock.,234
Jaws,"Most movies that come within a mile of this one's technical expertise hardly bother with such matters as logical human motivations, strong and unhammy acting and believable characters. Jaws, on the contrary, is rich in all of these.",234
Jaws,"In what may be the best example of the ""disaster"" movie trend thus far, the setting is not a towering inferno nor a crippled airliner but a quiet resort town terrorized by an ancient, primitive and universal fear.",234
Jaws,The Marquis de Sade was offended by what he called the cruel indifference of nature... And it is this same indifference that makes Jaws so terrifying and sickening.,234
Jaws,"The novelty is thin; and if it weren't for the huge national publicity campaign which tells you I'm out of my mind, I'd say it's routine stuff.",234
Jaws,"The first of an anticipated series of summer blockbuster films, Jaws pricks a psychological nerve, and is commercial, gory, and well enough produced to draw turn-away crowds.",234
Mars Attacks!,"Even with a few decent laughs and unforgettable antagonists, the end result isn’t spectacular; it’s a unique sci-fi genre blend, recalling productions from a bygone era of schlockier monster movies, but it’s only moderately entertaining.",235
Mars Attacks!,It’s such a wonderful lampoon of the establishment and hammers in Burton’s disdain for those in charge. It’s also got the frenetic spirit of a PG-13 Tex Avery/Chuck Jones/Bob Clampett cartoon.,235
Mars Attacks!,"It's not the funniest, saddest, or most poignant film in Tim Burton's filmography, but it is a great deal of fun. (25th anniversary)",235
Mars Attacks!,Mars Attacks! may well be the last whiff of that Burton magic so cherished by generations of angsty teens.,235
Mars Attacks!,Director Tim Burton fashions a hilariously twisted form of the alien invasion movie by skewering every silly sci-fi flick that ever had a budget smaller than its brain.,235
Mars Attacks!,Mars Attacks! plays its loony action for intentional laughs.,235
Mars Attacks!,"Mars is a fireball of failure, a B-movie crammed full of A-list actors, an exercise in tacky self-indulgence that will numb you with its labored eccentricities. What's more, it would take a greater detective than I to find a single funny line.",235
Mars Attacks!,"[Mars Attacks!] works well enough, though never well enough to make up for the fact that Burton ultimately settles for less.",235
Mars Attacks!,"A giddily madcap, surreal, sardonic satire that sets out to be deliberately cheesy.",235
Mars Attacks!,"Oh, those Martians! They are funny, mean little buggers, and they're worthing checking out.",235
Citizen Ruth,"The movie's most charming characteristic is, in fact, its irreverence: It bears the tell-tale signs of a young director taking aim at, and then laughing off, the absurdities of the world he grew up in.",236
Citizen Ruth,"Uncharacteristically of Payne, the film lacks a sharp point of view, unfloding as a series of gigs (some quite funny), trying to be too fair--for a satire--to both sides of the abortion issue.",236
Citizen Ruth,Wicked comedy about abortion conflict. Dern is terrific.,236
Citizen Ruth,"Payne didn't hit his stride until Election, but this is a good film.",236
Citizen Ruth,Payne's biting social satire about the abortion issue is shrewd and raucously entertaining. A smart and subversive comedy,236
Citizen Ruth,"Worst of all is Dern, who is so gratingly offensive that by the end of the movie you really just want her to shut up more than anything else.",236
Citizen Ruth,An auspicious debut for director Payne that did more than hint at teh great things to come.,236
Citizen Ruth,Bold drama about the dangers of zealotry.,236
Citizen Ruth,Its weak position on the issues allowed it to throw stones at everyone and seem like it was hip to what was going on.,236
Citizen Ruth,"The movie's most charming characteristic is, in fact, its irreverence: It bears the tell-tale signs of a young director taking aim at, and then laughing off, the absurdities of the world he grew up in.",236
Jerry Maguire,"Transportive cinema is never better when a great actor and director (Cameron Crowe) are, well, showing us the money and letting us go on an emotional shopping spree.",237
Jerry Maguire,"For all its salient points about surviving in the ’90s workplace and rediscovering the true measure of success, the film is ultimately an old-fashioned love story.",237
Jerry Maguire,"A promising filmmaker gives audiences just what they crave with Jerry Maguire, a moderately in depth look at the world of sports client management.",237
Jerry Maguire,One of the most popular and important romantic comedies of the 1990s (25th anniversary),237
Jerry Maguire,"Jerry Maguire still holds up as a superb emotional roller-coaster, charming comedy and surprisingly deep meditation on intimacy, connectivity and toxic masculinity.",237
Jerry Maguire,"Young Tom Cruise's stock characters were arrogant, self-centered, slick, warrior-magician-dominant boyish-men, who eventually evolve their inner lover and king, per the mytho-poetic men's movement vernacular. ""Jerry Maguire"" is a perfect example.",237
Jerry Maguire,Jerry Maguire benefits tremendously from Cruise's magnetic and predictably charismatic turn as the arrogant yet sympathetic central character...,237
Jerry Maguire,"The dialogue is superb, bringing these relatable characters and their grounded situations an extraordinary sense of authenticity and hilarity.",237
Jerry Maguire,Jerry Maguire offers the best of both worlds: romance and sports.,237
Jerry Maguire,"It's an easy charmer that manages to avoid the paint-by-numbers traps most romantic comedies fall into. Cruise should make more movies like this and Cameron Crowe should make more movies, period.",237
Raising Arizona,It’s a joyous satire about what it takes to raise a baby in a chaotic world and a slick crime caper with unforgettable characters and quirks.,238
Raising Arizona,"Two features into their career, Raising Arizona shows that the Coens are as effective with comedies as they were with neo-noir.",238
Raising Arizona,A distinct calling card for their more overtly comedic instincts; a frenetic farce that combines slapstick sensibilities and giddy playfulness with the English language...,238
Raising Arizona,Amiably gonzo pretty much nonstop.,238
Raising Arizona,"Coens have not achieved the maturity needed to appreciate the vision of a Capra or Sturges, and their gifts are too rich and deep for the likes of Heckle and Jeckle.",238
Raising Arizona,"What we get from the opening sequence of 'Raising Arizona' is the brilliance of Burwells score, the poetic storytelling of Hi, and Sonnenfelds imposing camera work. The opening sequence to Raising Arizona could be a short film in and of itself.",238
Raising Arizona,"The Coen's best pure comedy, driven by that great chase scene (35th anniversary)",238
Raising Arizona,"Raising Arizona is a funny, charming film with a strong visual style, delightful performances, and a unique sense of humor.",238
Raising Arizona,"Though Raising Arizona is one of their funniest and most accessible films, it is also among their most introspective.",238
Raising Arizona,...ultimately one of the Coens' kinder (if not gentler) efforts.,238
Sneakers,"Director and co-writer Phil Alden Robinson abandons the sentiment of Field of Dreams for a film that's just as manipulative, but a lot more fun -- good, commercial moviemaking.",239
Sneakers,"Enduring past its tech's sell-by date, it's still ""Mission: Quite Possible,"" with pragmatic paranoia, perfect pacing and thoughtful reflection on how tough it is to reconcile rage against the machine after the machine assimilates your method of rebellion.",239
Sneakers,"Part of the pleasure afforded by such a sequence comes from the careful exposition of intricate teamwork, combined with an adroit attention to the personalities involved.",239
Sneakers,There's plenty to like about Sneakers. There's just a little less than you might expect.,239
Sneakers,...persistently (and increasingly) engrossing...,239
Sneakers,"This is basically dumb fun with a veneer of smart fun... Fast-paced, utterly enjoyable.",239
Sneakers,"The movie would probably swing along fine as an out-and-out spoof or a serious thriller, but instead it lacks force in either direction.",239
Sneakers,"Despite its dream-team cast, the loosely laced ""Sneakers"" stumbles badly as both a comedy and as thriller.",239
Sneakers,"It's a surprise to discover a cerebral, 25-year-old film following the blueprint for today's endless glut of superhero movies.",239
Sneakers,"Sneakers often feels like it was made by a computer, but with a cast this likable you can watch it without feeling programmed.",239
Beavis and Butt-head Do America,It's funny how something so stupid can also be pretty clever at the same time.,240
Beavis and Butt-head Do America,What a pair of glorious morons; this movie is still such an affront to intelligence and deliriously funny.,240
Beavis and Butt-head Do America,Some undeniably funny bits are spread out over a movie that's otherwise juvenile and redundant.,240
Beavis and Butt-head Do America,A hilarious adaptation of an equally hysterical series.,240
Beavis and Butt-head Do America,Its idiocy is irresistible.,240
Beavis and Butt-head Do America,Huh huh huh. That was cool.,240
Beavis and Butt-head Do America,"A satisfying mix of puerile humour and genuine satire, believe it or not.",240
Beavis and Butt-head Do America,"Chock-full of lavatorial, morally deviant and moronic humour -- the best kind, of course.",240
Beavis and Butt-head Do America,"Whatever your I.Q., it's really one of the more enjoyable animated films since Snow White.",240
Beavis and Butt-head Do America,Faithful fans of the MTV series will no doubt be amused. But the few newcomers who pay the price of admission likely will wonder what all the fuss has been about.,240
"Last of the Mohicans, The","Anchored by a performance of almost Zen-like calm and focus by a lithe Daniel Day-Lewis and another of muted but fierce intensity by Madeleine Stowe, it is nothing less than a cinematic second coming.",241
"Last of the Mohicans, The","The rest of us can revel in what is certainly the best historically minded Hollywood movie since Glory, one that respects the intelligence of its story, its characters and its audience.",241
"Last of the Mohicans, The","As an amoral and anti-political period piece, deeply invested in the futility of war, the movie's brute splendor is all the more moving because it's so extravagantly doomed.",241
"Last of the Mohicans, The","A film that restores to the screen what it used to do best: grandeur of scale, intimacy of people, generosity of emotion, a subtext of saga and legend. Oh hell, what’s the word for it? Yes, “epic.”",241
"Last of the Mohicans, The","In a sense, Mr. Mann has returned to the very roots of motion pictures. With its tumultuous flow of music and images, “Mohicans” is like a long-lost something from the era of silent movies.",241
"Last of the Mohicans, The","The Last Of The Mohicans manages a remarkable double life. It is pure escapism, traditional heroics writ huge. Yet it is also realistic, each and every inch imbued with authenticity and conviction.",241
"Last of the Mohicans, The","As for Daniel Day-Lewis, he proves once again that he is one of those chameleons who can play absolutely anything with complete conviction.",241
"Last of the Mohicans, The","The violence is brutal and graphic, yet compelling. Such realism may keep away the light of heart, but those hungry for rich fare made expressly for the big screen will devour this epic with heart and soul.",241
"Last of the Mohicans, The",[Michael Mann's] sheer enthusiasm for his creation makes the film almost irresistible entertainment.,241
"Last of the Mohicans, The","A fierce, combustible, charismatic performance, Day-Lewis' Nathaniel Poe, a.k.a. Hawkeye, a.k.a. the Long Carabine, is the great glue that holds together Michael Mann's visceral, nearly abstract version of James Fenimore Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans.",241

Smilla's Sense of Snow,"Bad title, good movie.",244
Smilla's Sense of Snow,An atmospheric and enjoyably preposterous mystery.,244
Smilla's Sense of Snow,Fascinating setting and strong performances make up for the far-fetched plotting.,244
Smilla's Sense of Snow,A truly outlandish twist that would be more at home in a no-brainer Hollywood action film than in what purports to be an intelligent adult thriller.,244
Smilla's Sense of Snow,"Odd, atmospheric thriller that completely falls apart in the finale",244
Smilla's Sense of Snow,The idiotic ending seems to belong to another movie.,244
Smilla's Sense of Snow,"An underrated and effective thriller, buoyed by a fine performance from Julia Ormond.",244

"Devil's Own, The",...a watchable thriller that ultimately fares best in its compelling first half...,245
"Devil's Own, The",A beguiling but ultimately leaden tale of moral conflict.,245
"Devil's Own, The","Fortunately for us (and for Pakula), Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt are bona fide movie stars: their charisma is a considerable compensation.",245
"Devil's Own, The","While this film runs almost two hours, it seems longer because of the pacing.",245
"Devil's Own, The","An engrossing but disappointing big-budget political suspense film, that never becomes exceptional.",245

"Devil's Own, The",Finally just another schoolmarmish prestige piece touting America's moral superiority,245
"Devil's Own, The","What's left is a lot of moral grappling, not all of which has one iota of relevance to the plot.",245
"Devil's Own, The",A cobbled-together mess of conflicting tones.,245
Chasing Amy,"The moment marks a turning point in Rodgers’s agreeable documentary, which sets out to provide a contemporary lens on “Chasing Amy.”",246
Chasing Amy,"These inner dramas eventually take center stage, with Rodgers ultimately realizing that whatever mysterious purpose Chasing Amy played in his life has since been fulfilled, replaced with more meaningful growth.",246
Chasing Amy,Starts as another in a long line of disposable auto-docs from ppl desperate to lend their pop culture darlings greater cultural significance before becoming something a bit more complicated in its back half.,246
Chasing Amy,"""Chasing Chasing Amy"" is an insightful look back at the movie and the place it occupies in queer culture, the '90s canon and the lives of those it touched, both for better and for worse. It's well worth chasing down.",246
Chasing Amy,This documentary is ultimately a strong and important examination of how popular entertainment can touch and move us in unexpected and deeply personal ways.,246
Chasing Amy,Chasing Chasing Amy is an impressive reminder that discussions on the art of filmmaking can be much more nuanced.,246
Chasing Amy,“Chasing Chasing Amy” is a fan’s story that grapples affectionately with the complicated legacy of Smith’s film.,246

Chasing Amy,Rodgers shares the perspectives of the “Chasing Amy” creative team and social influencers to create an illuminating look on the impact of art on life.,246
Chasing Amy,"The intensity of Rodgers’ affinity for Chasing Amy, while understandable, in some ways makes him the least effective person to hear or respond to criticisms of it.",246
Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie,Those with no investment in MMPR lore will find it tough going throughout.,247

Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie,"Like the TV series, the pic features makeup and special-effects gimmickry that are far less persuasive than what might be found at second-rate theme-park attractions.",247
Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie,"With minimalist and universal fantasies as their points of departure, the superheroic deeds evolve only incrementally beyond the realistic -- a deeply satisfying process.",247
Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie,"The dialogue is atrocious, as are the wretched signature Morphin moves: Someone get these Rangers to a martial-arts school!",247
Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie,Nearly unbearable.,247

Grosse Pointe Blank,"Of the many violence-inflected black comedies that Pulp Fiction spawned, Grosse Pointe Blank ranks among the best [...] It never feels derivative [and] finds its own identity as a quirky romcom.",248
Grosse Pointe Blank,"Director George Armitage gets the mix of wry humor and edgy violence dead on, and [John] Cusack’s cocked-grin charm and earnest determination tells us not to take it all too seriously without sinking his character into farce.",248
Grosse Pointe Blank,"Starring 80s poster boy John Cusack and featuring a blistering soundtrack curated by Joe Strummer, ‘Grosse Pointe Blank’ is like John Hughes directed The Killer.",248
Grosse Pointe Blank,"The big joke in Grosse Pointe Blank is that it treats being a professional killer like its just another profession, one thats gotten staid and corporate (25th anniversary)",248
Grosse Pointe Blank,"...a fun, engaging film to keep the spirits up...",248
Grosse Pointe Blank,"Cusack might seem a bit frail to be regarded as a hitman, but his hyper-cool manner and razor-sharp delivery of the movie's cracking dialogue is never anything but convincing.",248
Grosse Pointe Blank,"As a satire, Grosse Pointe Blank doesn't completely add up-the parts are greater than the whole-but it's very much alive and kicking.",248
Grosse Pointe Blank,"Tackling the ravages of time with a rambunctious tone, ""Blank"" wraps emotional entropy and existential rumination into a clever, conceptual comedy that befits the '90s brethren like ""Defending Your Life"" or ""Groundhog Day"" alongside which it stands.",248
Grosse Pointe Blank,"[John] Cusack could not possibly have more perfect timing, and [Minnie] Driver could not be a better foil.",248
Grosse Pointe Blank,"Quirky mix of laughs, romance, strong violence.",248
Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,...an inherently-compelling premise that’s employed to continually engaging and hilarious effect by Roach...,249
Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,Mike Meyers’ parody of classic James Bond movies and various 1960s copycats like Matt Helm and Derek Flint careens from gag to gag with such pop art color and energy that you don’t really mind that it misses the target so often.,249
Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,"Of course the plot isn't the most engaging and the film isn't super deep or impactful, but I had a legitimately great time with Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery!",249
Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,After a small dose it can be a bit taxing.,249
Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,"Hugely influential at the time but getting old relatively quickly Austin Powers-mania was a major force in the late 90s and early 2000s, especially when the sequels arrived in 1999 and 2002. (25th anniversary)",249
Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,The result is a thoroughly entertaining slice of enjoyable escapism.,249
Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,"Whereas many 1990s comedies might draw a horrified wince from future generations, the film is relatively unproblematic. At least, for a film featuring penis pumps and literal toilet humour.",249
Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,Austin Powers remains a blast of swinging silliness with gags that are not only well observed but affectionate for the era they parody.,249
Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,"Comedy is a lot of hard work, but Myers and co make it look easy, and Austin Powers deserves its place amongst the comedy greats...",249
Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,"Whilst the heavy lifting might fall on Myers, Jay Roach's film is elevated by a series of great supporting performances.",249
"Fifth Element, The","Released in 1997, it's remarkable how well Luc Besson's The Fifth Element still holds up, nearly three decades after its initial release.",250
"Fifth Element, The","As irresistible—if occasionally annoying—popcorn-munching escapism, The Fifth Element remains an experience of diversionary entertainment, and almost exclusively about rehashing previously explored surfaces with a new sheen.",250
"Fifth Element, The","A sci-fi film a million aesthetic miles away from the industrial dystopias, dusty wastelands, and sterile starships of most screen SF of the time.",250
"Fifth Element, The",...a distinctive Moebius-inspired gumbo that's easy to enjoy...,250
"Fifth Element, The",Visionary filmmaker Luc Besson manages to create several of the most exotic and original characters for this magnum opus of sensory outlandishness.,250
"Fifth Element, The","The brains behind The Fifth Element would have been better off adding a sixth element - common sense - to the plot, and allowing it to form a bridge between the film's fantastic visual appeal and its ramshackle plot.",250
"Fifth Element, The","The Fifth Element is a bold, bright, loud, rowdy, lush, extravagant science fiction space opera that wears its heart on its garish sleeve.",250
"Fifth Element, The","Aside from Besson's impressive directorial panache, always providing something eye-catching and original to look at...there is little else about The Fifth Element that is particularly noteworthy.",250
"Fifth Element, The","It fuses slapstick with screwball comedy in brilliant ways, and appreciates the necessity of levity when considering heavy themes.",250
"Fifth Element, The","Narratively challenged, visually monotonous and aurally overpowering, The Fifth Element is a staggering accretion of all the wrong elements and some rather dopey ones as well.",250
Shall We Dance?,"A sunny, life-affirming celebration of simply hoofing it, any old how.",251
Shall We Dance?,"British director Peter Chelsom proves to be an inspired choice. Dressing the film with an eye-pleasing kitsch retro look and sprinkling the proceedings with moments of eccentric humor, he recalls his fine earlier films.",251
Shall We Dance?,"""Shall We Dance?'' celebrates marriage, self-renewal, the benefits of acting on impulse and the courage to dance to your own mambo beat. Audiences susceptible to its charms will be dancing down the aisles.",251
Shall We Dance?,"But there is nothing even deliciously bad or even fun bad in Shall We Dance, you won't find a moment of emotional truth, anywhere, nowhere, not in Richard Gere's twinkly demeanor, or in Susan Sarandon's googly eyeballs.",251
Shall We Dance?,Cute romance that is marred by homophobia.,251
Shall We Dance?,Touches to make 'hip' what should be an unabashedly square story--such as the casting of Nick Cannon in a supporting role and an out-of-nowhere cameo by Ja Rule--more jar than gel.,251
Shall We Dance?,"Inevitably this film will be compared to its predecessor, and it simply can't win.",251
Shall We Dance?,This excellent and acclaimed cast is shoved into a film whose screenplay should have alerted them that it's not ready to go before the cameras.,251
Shall We Dance?,"Not as good as the original, but enjoyable nonetheless.",251
Shall We Dance?,"It's rather cute, but only the truly girly will fall for the decidedly Officer And A Gentlemanly denouement that injects a belated sexy note.",251
"Lost World: Jurassic Park, The","Jurassic Park gives everything you could ask of a blockbuster adventure movie, and much of what you might ask of a horror movie. The thrills are executed sharply, and strike the perfect tone when juxtaposed against moments of wonder and true movie magic.",252

"Lost World: Jurassic Park, The","Jurassic Park is a legendary film full of a number of scary set pieces, but its most frightening sequence is one without dinosaurs.",252
"Lost World: Jurassic Park, The","It has a thrill or two, and a chill or three, but it has no poetry, little sense of wonder, no resonant subtext, no art.",252
"Lost World: Jurassic Park, The",“Jurassic Park” turned out to be an incredible visual achievement and a groundbreaking step forward for movie technology.,252
"Pillow Book, The","As formally challenging as The Pillow Book may be, it romantically creates a love affair unbound by its physical limits, connecting it to past and present through art and literature.",253
"Pillow Book, The","Greenaway makes movies like no other human being, and The Pillow Book is rarely satisfied with a single image. It uses overlapping subframes, trace images, and hieroglyphs, dissolving in and out of view like a picture-in-picture TV screen gone lyrical.",253
"Pillow Book, The","As intricately assembled as all of Greenaway's works, and representing one of the last films from famed DoP Sacha Vierney, The Pillow Book is worthy of a revisit, easily existing within its own timeless universe.",253
"Pillow Book, The","One of the most accomplished chapters in Peter Greenaway's quest to turn movies into books, this may be the writer-director's metaphorical autobiography.",253
"Pillow Book, The","In The Pillow Book, text and texture meet so exquisitely. Sex is a visual art, Greenaway says, and writing is a matter of life and death.",253
"Pillow Book, The","It is exciting that in an age of mass book signings and disrespect for literature, Greenaway is able to sexualize the author's signature as it sweeps up a woman's neck.",253
"Pillow Book, The","Greenaway provides a visual feast, then he kills your appetite.",253
"Pillow Book, The",The Pillow Book is an experiment in the potential of film. It rejects convention and asks the viewer to forget traditions and entrenched assumptions. Those willing to go along will be hypnotized.,253
"Pillow Book, The","Greenaway is a dedicated aesthete and sensualist who creates his own little worlds of cruelty, delight and artistic trickery. With tremendous brio and skill, he cuts his patterns into our minds, tickling our skins with his brush.",253
"Pillow Book, The","I can, with many reservations, recommend The Pillow Book for graphic artists and, of course, for Star Wars completists. People who simply can't get enough nudity might also want to take a look.",253
Batman & Robin,"It’s hard to hate a movie that’s so fun, even if it’s quite flawed.",254
Batman & Robin,"If you can look past the film’s obvious flaws, Batman & Robin is still a fun time and it knows exactly what it wants to be: a kooky, nutty story made for kids.",254
Batman & Robin,"It's not good, but it's not the total disaster its legacy would suggest. As an ode to the Silver Age of the Caped Crusader, it gets a lot of things right, but the pacing grinds to a halt any time one of our heroes is on screen. Thank god for Uma Thurman.",254
Batman & Robin,"There's pleasure to be found in how campy Joel Schumacher's second Batman outing is (puns!), but everyone except Thurman and Schwarzenegger are phoning their performances in. Too long and too focused on toy sales, this is excess, but not the good kind.",254
Batman & Robin,Batman & Robin really feels as if director Joel Schumacher was painting by numbers.,254
Batman & Robin,"Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy is camp personified once her violent transformation is complete, purring out her ridiculous lines like the movie stars of old.",254
Batman & Robin,"Perhaps most disheartening of all is the fact that every character in the film defies gravity, physics, and any form of logic in their clunky or obnoxiously vivid designs.",254
Batman & Robin,It's honestly a miracle anyone was ever willing to see a Batman movie again after this film.,254
Batman & Robin,"Batman & Robin was definitely not the late great Joel Schumacher's best accomplishment, it's one that will definitely live on in infamy, and a movie that people are still able to find joy from, in spite of its many flaws. Excess never dies.",254
Batman & Robin,It all feels like it's a smidgeon away from being a spoof movie.,254

My Best Friend's Wedding,"My Best Friend’s Wedding dared to acknowledge that, sometimes, a friendship shared between two people who love each other can be just as important as a romantic partnership.",255
My Best Friend's Wedding,"The buoyant, bittersweet ""Wedding"" puts new fizz in an old form.",255
My Best Friend's Wedding,"Although [Hogan] stages most of the scenes in a straightforward way for Friend's Wedding, there are some charming, offbeat touches here. One wishes he'd mined some of the story's kinkier subtexts a bit more, but hey ... this is a commercial-minded flick.",255
My Best Friend's Wedding,"A bittersweet, modern-love morsel, this scrumptious drama should touch moviegoers' hearts in this action gorged summer.",255
My Best Friend's Wedding,A poor imitation of a screwball comedy.,255
My Best Friend's Wedding,We don't feel much of anything.,255
My Best Friend's Wedding,The draggy narrative of this 1997 comedy is tough to sit through -- there are even several overproduced musical numbers -- but it does have an intriguing subversive element that I don't want to give away.,255
My Best Friend's Wedding,"Hogan's follow-up to Muriel's Wedding rolls smoothly over the bumps in the plot, oiled by a witty acerbic script and strong central performances.",255
My Best Friend's Wedding,"This amiable comedy may not be hugely sophisticated, but Hogan does manage to make his attractive leads look like complete idiots, no mean achievement in image-obsessed Hollywood.",255
When the Cats Away,A charming French import with lots of heart.,256
When the Cats Away,An irresistibly charming French film about the magical and charming ways in which community is created in large cities.,256
When the Cats Away,"When the Cat's Away is like a very subtle, curious, edgy documentary, in which we get interested in Chloe because she has lost her cat, and by the end we almost have to be reminded that the cat is missing.",256
When the Cats Away,"Leave it to the French to take an idea as simple as a young woman searching for her lost cat and turn it into an evocation of life, love, and the big city.",256
Men in Black,"…a lethargic, uninspired and rather inessential adventure propped up by extended cameos…",257
Men in Black,You have to think this will mark the end of a franchise that (if we’re honest) probably shouldn’t have been resurrected to begin with.,257
Men in Black,"Men In Black: International is a sterile, stodgy, nondescript, and overall boring spin-off of a beloved (but not really) franchise.",257
Men in Black,They give you time to get oriented to the new cast.,257
Men in Black,"Gender equality should be shown, not joked about.",257
Men in Black,Unless there is a mass neuralization of audiences Men in Black: International will not make us forget the charms of the first MIB film.,257

Men in Black,"The magic, humor, and chemistry is missing between Hemsworth and Thompson confirming that three sequels are too many.",257
Men in Black,"To quote Emma Thompson's character, Men in Black: International feels like a case of deja vu dismissed just as quickly.",257
Men in Black,It's a decent film that never rises up to its potential.,257
Contact,"The director does just fine with the tools that he has to work with. It is not exactly a classic, but it is pretty damned entertaining.",258
George of the Jungle,George of the Jungle is still an all-around fun time with plenty of laughs after a quarter of a century.,259
George of the Jungle,"Fraser is so earnest in his desire to make a family oriented, innocent film that watching him speak ape just has to make you chuckle.",259
George of the Jungle,What sets the film apart is a script that has the good sense to laugh at itself.,259
George of the Jungle,Live-action take on popular tale is family fun.,259
George of the Jungle,Surprisingly pleasant.,259
George of the Jungle,"Not quite inspired lunacy, the film has a game, likable quality and strong sequel potential.",259
George of the Jungle,"An uninspired, if mildly likeable, spin on the Tarzan legend from Disney.",259
George of the Jungle,Amiable but toothless...,259
George of the Jungle,The story is incidental -- the villain wants to abduct the talking ape for financial gain -- and thankfully the animatronics and computer effects aren't allowed to overwhelm the proceedings.,259
George of the Jungle,"This is off-beat, goofy, entertaining summer fun.",259
Event Horizon,"With inspirations varying from Hieronymus Bosch and Warhammer 40,000 to the literal architecture of the Notre Dame Cathedral and Fritz Lang, Paul WS Anderson’s ... Event Horizon [is] one of the great 20th-century space-horror films.",260
Event Horizon,... he screenplay is not nearly as inventive as the production design and it turns into a woefully inconsistent psychic monster movie that sacrifices mood for tepid shocks.,260
Event Horizon,"[Production designer Joseph Bennett's] sets never fail to give Event Horizon’s audience the willies. His work is good enough to surpass Anderson’s substandard direction, demand that viewers overlook the plot, and watch simply for the visual artistry.",260
Event Horizon,"…Event Horizon isn’t a great movie…but it’s a beautiful ruin, far better to look at than most 90’s films, and the mix of CGI and physical effects gels on an aesthetic level….",260
Event Horizon,Approaches some very silly third-tier post-Lovecraft nonsense with a enthusiastic desire to make it the most enjoyably trashy version of itself possible.,260
Event Horizon,"This is one of Anderson’s best films, offering genuine scares and a visionary design.",260
Event Horizon,"Since its release, 25 years ago, it has taken on quite the following, and for many, it is because of its spectacularly disturbing mashup of camp and horror, sci-fi, and well, Sam Neill.",260
Event Horizon,"If Alien was a slasher movie on a spaceship, this is a haunted house movie on a spaceship. Much more likely to please gorehounds than science-fiction fans. [4K Blu-ray]",260
Event Horizon,Worth a watch as it starts off slow and then gets better as it goes along.,260
Event Horizon,"In the end, and at least 30 minutes before, you get the idea that you're stranded in empty space.",260
Air Bud,Admirable for the way in which writers Paul Tamasy and Aaron Mendelsohn have injected a sense of reality amid lots of rousing fantasy calamities...,261
Air Bud,Dubious highlights include the dog wearing two pairs of basketball shoes and eating a frightening amount of vanilla pudding.,261
Air Bud,A smart pet trick that turns into a stupid movie.,261
Air Bud,"Who wouldn't love a story about a homeless golden retriever who runs away from his alcoholic clown for a father, Norm, to shoot hoops?",261
Air Bud,"The writing is so messy and aimless that when the film retrenches to generic kid flick mediocrity, it actually counts as a relief.",261
Air Bud,A high-flying dog tale for kids.,261
Air Bud,"There's an air of acceptance throughout the film, but the movie never stops to stand at a pulpit and preach this message.",261

Air Bud,"Ramshackle slapstick, upbeat life lessons and lashings of sentimentality.",261
In the Company of Men,"The dark side of Dilbert, Neil LaBute's scabrous In the Company of Men tells us all we ever wanted to know, or rather, all we already knew in our guts, about life on the postindustrial cube farm.",262
In the Company of Men,"Some viewers may be appalled by its heartlessness, but others will find it a cinematic acid bath that lays bare the awful truth.",262
In the Company of Men,"Ultimately, In the Company of Men may be a meditation on personal evil. And on a note as dour as that, I'd urge you to watch In the Company of Men, a 90s indie that's truly deserving of 'hidden gem' status.",262
In the Company of Men,"A dazzling, repellent exercise in which the case against men is closed before it's opened.",262
In the Company of Men,"LaBute, a playwright and former drama teacher, has succeeded in creating a study of banal, everyday evil.",262
In the Company of Men,A bitterly promising screenwriting-directing debut from playwright Neil LaBute.,262
In the Company of Men,"A dark, probing, truly disturbing exploration of yuppie angst and male anxieties as they manifest themselves in both the work and personal arenas.",262
In the Company of Men,"A highlight of the 97 Sundance Film Fest, LaBute's astonishing debut is a dark, probing, vastly entertaining satire about misogyny and sexual politics in the work as well as personal arena; LaBute is a major dialoguist to watch",262
In the Company of Men,"Cruel, cool and pleasingly provocative.",262
In the Company of Men,"A compelling, but not likable, film.",262
Steel,"Man of Steel is a genre story without the cartoon-like elements seen in past superhero films, presenting a gritty, torment-ridden reboot of the character’s origin story with intense emotional genuineness.",263
Steel,"While it might set itself apart from many superhero movies that came before it, it seems to do so arbitrarily as opposed to exploring those ideas in any organic way.",263
Steel,"Man of Steel was Snyder’s triumphant debut with Superman, and it’s still a thrilling example of why Clark Kent can be an engaging lead for one of these movies despite the speculation for the opposite.",263
Steel,Man of Steel is fun and makes a lot of sense a lot of the time but is also dull and senseless some of the time.,263
Steel,"You finish watching, hoping that better times might just be ahead ...",263
Steel,"Snyder’s film is humorless and flavorless, unmemorable and underwhelming, epic-sized but far from grand.",263
Steel,It’s a movie that offers a unique vision laced with fun summer action while also showing a level of respect for the source material.,263
Steel,"If there is one word to describe Man of Steel, it would be a disappointment.",263
Steel,"Here is the main problem: it is a solid movie, but a terrible Superman movie.",263
Steel,"Man of Steel gets a lot right. The casting of Henry Cavill as Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent is spot-on. He brings the right notes of heroism and earnestness to the role, as well as embodying the physical presence of the character.",263

"Hunt for Red October, The","With enough of a corkscrew plot to keep anyone guessing and with plenty of edge-of-your-seat suspense, this high-stakes espionage thriller never misses a beat.",265
"Hunt for Red October, The","With a chilly majesty to its scale despite its confined locations, this is a supremely confident film with the courage of its convictions as the story slowly and steadily unfolds. 30 years on it still packs a powerful punch, the tension ratcheting.",265
"Hunt for Red October, The","It's to McTiernan's credit that so much of this is made intense. Every silence on board the Russian sub, whether they're squeaking through a narrow underwater canyon or sending out a single sonar ping, seems occasion to hold your breath.",265
"Hunt for Red October, The","Coupled with Connery's magnetic performance, that's enough to make The Hunt for Red October as watchable today as it was during its 1990 release.",265
"Hunt for Red October, The","the kind of action thriller that is rarely made today-one that emphasizes intellect and logic, intuition and political maneuvering over might and brawn",265

unknown,Strong performances all around. Maybe the mystery of Bob Dylan was never meant to be unraveled but I wish the film had tried to do that a little bit more.,267
unknown,"Timothée Chalamet delivers one of the finest turns of his career in A Complete Unknown as Bob Dylan, even if the movie’s script from James Mangold and Jay Cocks is not all that different from any biopic you have seen before.",267
unknown,"If you can get past that it’s operating on the well-trodden terrain of Canonical Boomer History, is almost entirely a success.",267
unknown,"Chalamet’s performance is only ever a shell of Dylan; His passion and purpose, the one he found in the very folk music this biopic zeroes in on, isn’t there.",267
unknown,"Mangold’s tribute to Bob Dylan is a sincere effort despite the near 2 ½ hours running time steeped in convention and light touches. But as a tried-and-tested formula, the confidence in Chalamet’s performance brings the vision home.",267
unknown,I felt like I was hearing these songs for the first time again. Everything about it made me feel special and like I was given a gift as a fan of Bob Dylan’s work.,267
unknown,"A grounded and entertaining drama featuring an award-worthy performance by Timothée Chalamet, who brilliantly captures Bob Dylan’s mysterious persona while giving audiences something to latch onto.",267
unknown,"Chalamet could have come off as an impersonator doing an “SNL” sketch. Instead, he inhabits Dylan self-effacingly. Among rock and roll biopic performances this one is right up there with Sissy Spacek as Loretta Lynn and Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison.",267
unknown,"Timothée Chalamet looks, acts, even sings like Bob Dylan in this biopic. But director James Mangold treats Dylan as a mythical figure rather than a person, leaving his mystery intact.",267
unknown,"With standout performances from Chalamet, Barbaro, and Norton, combined with Mangold’s assured direction, it’s a film that captures a moment in time where anything felt possible.",267
Chasing Amy,"The moment marks a turning point in Rodgers’s agreeable documentary, which sets out to provide a contemporary lens on “Chasing Amy.”",268
Chasing Amy,"These inner dramas eventually take center stage, with Rodgers ultimately realizing that whatever mysterious purpose Chasing Amy played in his life has since been fulfilled, replaced with more meaningful growth.",268

"Full Monty, The","Its social commentary, its unlikely but charismatic cast, and heartfelt but humorous writing has made it a film that many people find hard to forget.",269
"Full Monty, The","The Full Monty finds both pathos and laughs in its farfetched conceit, avoiding the pitfalls of sappiness and shtik. Odds are good you'll exit grinning.",269
Gattaca,A tremendously interesting movie that questions eugenics and beyond. [Full review in Spanish],270
Gattaca,"The writer-director crafts a paranoid, discriminatory world out of ripped-from-the-headlines science. Adopting a noirish mood amid an austere dystopian backdrop, it’s the sort of Orwellian vision that could only exist in a movie.",270
Gattaca,"A fascinating sci-fi drama that has stood the test of time with ease. The dense, romantic, somber atmosphere fits perfectly with the eerie topic that is incredibly close to us.",270
Gattaca,"You have to admire Niccol's humanizing agenda in movie terrain usually crowded with numbing technology and digital stereo explosions. But jeez, what a downer.",270
Gattaca,Gattaca relies on solid storytelling rather than lazily hoping to distract you with great visuals and special effects.,270
Gattaca,Gattaca boasts an excellent cast full of talented actors.,270
Gattaca,The fixating premise and the commentary on conviction defeating arbitrary inequities make for an unconventional and wholly entertaining experience.,270
Gattaca,"A clever and sly slab of sci-fi, depicting a future where the superior race will be people genetically assembled from the edited highlights of their parents.",270
Gattaca,...a deliberately-paced yet mostly spellbinding sci-fi drama...,270
Gattaca,Gattaca doesn't quite live up to the promise of its premise.,270
Starship Troopers,"Despite the high-tech special effects, director Verhoeven allows for a lot of campy fun. This movie does not take itself seriously.",271
Starship Troopers,The biting and ballsy social commentary of Verhoeven still holds up.,271
Starship Troopers,"A strong, almost outrageous representation of the military-industrial complex in the States, Verhoeven's sci-fi film benefits from being over the top in everything: its acting, its convoluted plot, its politics.",271
Starship Troopers,"Satirical and witty while seemingly bizarre, Starship Troopers flips its source material on its head and creates a memorable science fiction flick. It’s camouflaged by the misdirection that it’s a dumb bug movie when it’s actually quite intelligent.",271
Starship Troopers,"Verhoeven [and] screenwriter Edward Neumeier... transform the intergalactic platoon movie into a perverse concoction of patriotic fervor, fascist ideology, media satire, and military might, at once thrilling and sinister, energetic and cynical.",271
Starship Troopers,Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers is an odd and most distressing film.,271
Starship Troopers,Director Paul Verhoeven blends the conflicting elements of intentional camp and perverse sincerity into a single tone—and he doesn’t resort to simple irony.,271
Starship Troopers,…Starship Troopers is one prescient sci-fi epic well worth losing your heart to…,271
Starship Troopers,We can appreciate it for what it really is and notice the subtle comments it makes on the dangers of following along with leaders in a fascist society.,271
Starship Troopers,"It's not as serious as it is a comic variation on old-fashioned ideas. Kids won't get the tongue-in-cheek approach, but part of the appeal is that the movie works on both levels.",271
Good Will Hunting,...a predominantly engrossing drama that benefits from its compelling narrative and superb performances...,272
Good Will Hunting,Adding moments of erudition and salty wit to a feelgood tale proves to be a winning formula.,272
Good Will Hunting,"A terrifically warm, tender and entertaining story... In significant ways, the ""Rocky"" of the '90s.",272
Good Will Hunting,"It’s got a lively screenplay and fine performances all around, and it consistently delivers emotional payoffs. (25th anniversary)",272
Good Will Hunting,Good Will Hunting may follow a formulaic arc but Gus Vant Sant's direction and Robin Williams and Matt Damon's performances elevate the film.,272
Good Will Hunting,"Awash with emotion, but never descends in to the mawkish sentimentality that blights so many “kid with a problem” movies.",272
Good Will Hunting,Good Will Hunting is a grand coup from first-time writers Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Their exploration of the life of a Genius trying to function as a normal person is quite amiable and full of great acting.,272
Good Will Hunting,"The problem becomes more glaring when movies portray geniuses, characters who not only think constantly but think thoughts that are incomprehensible to the rest of us.",272
Good Will Hunting,"It's writer-stars Matt Damon & Ben Affleck's childhood friendship-chemistry and the hilarious bickering between the real-life Affleck brothers that generates the magic in ""Good Will Hunting."" Not to mention a magical performance by Robin Williams.",272
Good Will Hunting,"While Damon and Affleck clearly feel at home with each other in familiar surroundings during Good Will Hunting, their story relies on heart more than location since caring and friendship taking precedence.",272
Heat,Sluggish noir thriller.,273
Heat,...familiar subject matter that’s employed to watchable yet entirely forgettable effect...,273
Heat,t may be one of the great comedies of the year. The only problem is that the people who made it thought they were making a gritty noir.,273
Heat,A cliched script and disappointing performances from a promising cast add Killer Heat to a long line of dissatisfying adaptations of the bestselling crime writer's work.,273
Heat,"Almost every character is a cliché, twice so during flashbacks to the private eye's predictably troubled personal life, and none of them have much hope of acquitting themselves well when tasked with delivering constantly dreary dialogue.",273
Heat,"Adapted from a short story by Jo Nesbo, this sun-drenched Mediterranean noir pushes hard-boiled menace and private eye diffidence to a tiring degree, but it lacks for a decent plot and even a hint of intrigue.",273
Heat,Gordon-Levitt and Woodley feel miscast in a noir-ish wannabe whose plot is too uncomplicated and obvious to not distract us with more lived-in characters who have done more than a single bad choice.,273
Heat,"What this old-fashioned noir lacks most is old-fashioned tension .... Still, the film holds our interest throughout its fleet-footed 90 minutes, and you could do a lot worse than hanging out in the Greek Isles with JGL.",273
Heat,"The director, Philippe Lacôte, does an okay job of unfurling the story, yet somehow it all lacks… heat. Maybe that’s because he wants the dots he’s connecting to be sentimental.",273
Heat,"Killer Heat has an interesting premise and a cast that could have given much more, but the movie fails to captivate or generate the necessary tension to keep the audience hooked. [Full review in Spanish]",273
Sabrina,"Sabrina Carpenter’s Nonsense Holiday may be a 2024 version of an early-20th-century format, but it retains the same spirit of nostalgia. And after the year we just had, cozy, comforting and familiar may be just what we all need.",274
Sabrina,"The comedy is fine, the duets are fun, but it is the Carpenter charisma that keeps it all flowing nicely.",274
Sabrina,"Overall, ‘A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter’ is a vibrant, fun-filled musical treat perfect for pop enthusiasts and festive revelers alike.",274
Sabrina,"Don’t expect to add it to your yearly viewing rotation unless you’re a Carpenter megafan, nor should you expect to add these covers to your holiday playlist, but as far as 50-minute variety specials go, there have been much worse.",274
Sense and Sensibility,Ang Lee’s adaptation of Jane Austen’s first novel respects the timeless material while bringing a contemporary energy and humour to the tale.,275
Sense and Sensibility,It is a gem. Miss Austen’s sly humor is everywhere present but never caricatured.,275
Sense and Sensibility,Spirited and luminous romantic film.,275
Sense and Sensibility,"Screenwriter Thompson and director Ang Lee maintain a rare balance. The actors, as well as the writer and director, constantly let us know that they know better than these characters.",275
Sense and Sensibility,I just love this story about these sisters,275
Sense and Sensibility,"Filmmaker Ang Lee, working from Thompson's screenplay, delivers an exceedingly (and often excessively) deliberate drama that's rarely as engrossing or involving as one might've expected (and hoped)...",275
Sense and Sensibility,"In Austen's world of amorous imbroglios, overflowing with misunderstandings, betrayals, and decisions bound by duty and honor, upper-crust affairs have never felt so riveting.",275
Sense and Sensibility,"This movie, made with love and wit, reminds us how much charm, liveliness, passion, good sense--and sensibility--Jane Austen provides.",275
Sense and Sensibility,The decision to hire Taiwan's Ang Lee to direct this adaptation of Jane Austen's first novel was truly inspired.,275
Sense and Sensibility,"A beautifully-crafted, witty, moving film likely to overcome even the stiffest Austen prejudice.",275
Leaving Las Vegas,It is the most boring film ever made -- worse than a documentary.,276
Leaving Las Vegas,Leaving Las Vegas is a relentless downer -- look at it as a love story for anyone who found The Bridges of Madison County too precious -- but it's worth sticking through for its two lead performances.,276
Leaving Las Vegas,The movie contains career-best performances from Nicolas Cage... and Elisabeth Shue.,276
Leaving Las Vegas,"A love story like no other, Mike Figgis's Leaving Las Vegas is a bleak, mesmerizing rhapsody of self-destruction, defiantly uninterested in peddling Hollywood-style uplift.",276
Leaving Las Vegas,"This movie was like watching a car crash in slow motion. You knew there was going to be a crash, but I just wished it would just happen already, and not have spent two hours getting to the impact.",276
Leaving Las Vegas,"What works, first and foremost, are the two lead performances.",276
Leaving Las Vegas,"[Shue's] terrific (and Oscar-nominated), but the movie belongs to Cage whose fierce, uncompromising performance is as serious as a hangover and as jittery as the shakes. You can practically smell the stale reek of his booze-soaked breath.",276
Leaving Las Vegas,The artistic direction of Figgis keeps it honest and unsentimental.,276
Leaving Las Vegas,"[VIDEO ESSAY] ""Leaving Las Vegas"" (1995) is a remarkably potent romantic drama that permanently altered the careers of many of the people involved in its creation.",276
Leaving Las Vegas,"Dark and giddy at the same time, Leaving Las Vegas takes us into dreamy, intoxicated places no movie about an alcoholic has gone before.",276
Restoration,"…Restoration may not match up with Tremain’s book, but the observation of the corrupt world around Downey Jr’s character is refreshingly bitter…",277
Restoration,"...an episodic drama that doesn't, to a progressively predominant extent, contain much in the way of forward momentum...",277
Restoration,"Michael Hoffman's Restoration is a handsome, intelligent version of Rose Tremain's novel, brimming with gilded images and elegant, paradoxical ideas.",277
Restoration,"Gorgeous, witty romp that",277
Restoration,Engaging if uneven.,277
Restoration,"An interesting evocation of a decadent era marked by opulence, excess and abject poverty. But works equally well as a study of personal redemption amidst the turmoil.",277
Restoration,"Ryan's hilariously out of place, but this is otherwise an entertaining yarn.",277
Restoration,"Since the robust 17th-century picaresque tale is not enjoying any current vogue, the success of ""Restoration"" can be considered a very pleasant surprise.",277
Restoration,"Despite its flaws, Restoration proves that Hollywood can at times treat history in satisfying manner.",277
Restoration,"Robert Downey, Jr. can do no wrong by me, and his expressiveness and irreverence are what make this film work. Seen through his eyes, the changing currents of the times are navigable only with large doses of dark humor and compassion.",277
Bed of Roses,"A good, even beautiful, premise, but this romance is stronger on ambience than development.",278
Bed of Roses,"A very sweet movie, Slater and Masterson encompass real sparks",278
Bed of Roses,Bed of Roses tells a sappy story about two sad sacks who get more or less what they deserve -- each other.,278
Bed of Roses,"Don't blame the leads, but the movie has less emotional resonance than an old FTD florist commercial with Merlin Olsen.",278
Once Upon a Time... When We Were Colored,"Everything about this film bespeaks wholesomeness, from its gentle life lessons to its calm dignity ... (t)hat said, it is not quite as good as some of the hype would have it.",279
Once Upon a Time... When We Were Colored,"Based on Clifton Taulbert's book, this sensitive memory film about the author's coming of age in the segregated South is an emotionally quiet saga, plaved against a tumultuous era in black communal life.",279
Once Upon a Time... When We Were Colored,Heart-warming drama in which community becomes a seedbed where young souls are forged.,279
Once Upon a Time... When We Were Colored,"Rarely has a film more movingly shown how people who work, live and pray together can find a common strength and self-respect.",279
Once Upon a Time... When We Were Colored,"The acting is good all round, but the star of the show has to be Al Freeman Jr. He shows great inner strength, bravery, and intelligence.",279
Once Upon a Time... When We Were Colored,"Though the film exhibits a vaguely nostalgic tone, it's hardly sugar-coated, displaying an increasingly discernible edge to its portrayal of racist realities.",279
"River Wild, The","This is the movies, and director Curtis Hanson throws so much water at us that we are too enjoyably discomposed to think anyway.",281
"River Wild, The","The sympathetic characters are likeable, the chief villain someone you hope to see blown away, the stuntwork on the rapids is terrific.",281
"River Wild, The",Go and have fun; and wear waterproof clothing.,281
"River Wild, The","The film is energetically directed by Curtis Hanson, and it's certainly a refreshing change to see an action heroine at the helm, bossing all the men about.",281
"River Wild, The","Meryl Streep proves she's an all-acting heroine in The River Wild, an exciting though predictable outdoor thriller.",281
"River Wild, The","The scenery, mostly photographed in Montana, is spectacular. The musical score, composed by the always-rousing Jerry Goldsmith, is lively.",281
"River Wild, The","[Streep] never looks truly comfortable in the role, lacking the presence of a Sigourney Weaver or Genna Davis in The Long Kiss Goodnight.",281
"River Wild, The",...a deliberately-paced yet consistently watchable thriller...,281
"River Wild, The",[A] likable caper.,281
"River Wild, The","A stale product of Movieland mechanics, diluted from Griffith's Way Down East and John Boorman's Deliverance, this picture is just one more reason to worry about an outstanding talent.",281
"Time to Kill, A","The performances are strong, the issues provocative.",282
"Time to Kill, A","There is a lot in here that is effective, and plenty that works. There is simply also a lot that doesn’t.",282
"Time to Kill, A","In order to enjoy this mediocre John Grisham courtroom drama, labeled as top-notch entertainment by many of my colleagues, you have to accept an ersatz, cartoonish version of the deep south...",282
"Time to Kill, A",...a slow-moving yet mostly engrossing drama...,282
"Time to Kill, A","It's not perfect, but perhaps that's part of its sometimes pulpy joy (and certainly McConaughey's character flaws are part of his charm).",282
"Time to Kill, A","Better grab those homemade wigs and gavels, because here comes another ripping, one-size-fits-all slab of legal eaglery from the platinum paperback pen of John ""you can buy my collected works at any airport newsagent"" Grisham.",282
"Time to Kill, A",Legal drama candidly tackles race relations in America.,282
"Time to Kill, A","(Grisham) films are... grossly over-inflated examples of that old genre which hardly ever need change, the courtroom drama. A Time To Kill is no different, except that its verdict would be laughed out of any court anywhere in the civilised world.",282
"Time to Kill, A",A likable -- maybe even lovable -- movie.,282
"Time to Kill, A",What craven offal!,282
Emma,Emma is the kind of film that will take its audience through a range of emotions. You will laugh and some may cry but everyone will leave the cinema knowing they have watched a delightfully entertaining film.,283
Emma,"Some may find the film’s pacing rather slow, and those who aren’t fans of period dramas may struggle to connect to the film. However, there’s no denying the fact that Emma is one of the most visually impressive films to come along in a long while.",283
Emma,"Sumptuously designed, elegantly appointed and spectacularly costumed and coiffed, de Wilde’s fresh rendition has a piquant flavor complemented as much by self-aware sexiness as the abundant pastel hues on display.",283
Emma,"Lacks surprising elements, making the existence of this new adaptation a bit questionable. Why make another film if there's nothing unique about it? Predictable from the get-go, confusing first act, and very hard to feel invested before the one-hour mark.",283
Emma,Austen is as compelling as ever.,283
Emma,"Very witty and well-acted... Emma has been adapted a number of times, but this has enough intelligence in its adaptation to stand out from the crowd.",283
Emma,"De Wilde's mannerist visual approach won't help endear the character to skeptics, as the film shows evidence of a director more interested in design, style, and particulars of performance than the substance and emotions at work in Austen's story.",283
Emma,"A witty, candy-coloured and charmingly unassuming big-screen adaptation of Austen's novel.",283
Emma,The universal acknowledgement continues: Jane Austen knew how to write a fun movie.,283
Emma,What the film does have is that sweetness: sugary yet crisp rather than cloying.,283
Tin Cup,Costner’s childish charm and Shelton’s devotion to sports turn this overlong feature into an absolute joy.,284
Tin Cup,"Watch for the sometimes outrageous golf action, stay for the magnificent banter and sizzling chemistry.",284
Tin Cup,Tin Cup might not be a classic in the way that Bull Durham was but it still works as a sports rom-com even if the film is slightly long.,284
Tin Cup,"Eight years after collaborating on the best sports movie ever made, Bull Durham's writer-director and star reunited for another film in the same vein.",284
Tin Cup,It is a charmer from tee-off to final putt.,284
Tin Cup,"The good news about the amiable but only partly satisfying Tin Cup is that it frees Kevin Costner from playing a monument and restores to us the loose, sparkling comic actor he used to be.",284
Tin Cup,"The dialogue and characters are convincing and intelligently developed. Russo wears vulnerability and neediness like a second skin, while Costner plays the tragic hero with considerable charm.",284
Tin Cup,"As he always does in comedy, Costner grants an irresistible gleam of gallantry to male mulishness.",284
Tin Cup,Tin Cup works for viewers of any handicap.,284
Tin Cup,"You can almost feel writer-director Ron Shelton praying for lightning to strike twice, but to no avail.",284
Secrets & Lies,"Whether it be a contemporary or a period piece, Leigh once again provides a provocative portrait on a subject that can (dis)connect the family dynamics in any area.",285
Secrets & Lies,"This is exactly the challenge taken up by Leigh: bring film back to its community calling and remember that, beyond the confusion of images and identities, there are... people with pasts, sufferings, things to say, families -- and we are all part of it.",285
Secrets & Lies,"A benchmark for comedy dramas, this award-winning 1996 film is a bonafide masterpiece.",285
Secrets & Lies,"Much of Secrets & Lies unfolds as if we're peeking around corners, watching Mike Leigh's characters struggle with personal, yet hidden, pain. Everyone in the film is hurting but unwilling to reach out to others in the family.",285
Secrets & Lies,"a masterful dramedy about that wonderfully, terribly complex thing we call family",285
Secrets & Lies,"It's a beautifully performed British film which sensitively explores issues surrounding identity, race, roots and class.",285
Secrets & Lies,"Secrets & Lies is a mesmerizing film, with the emotional stakes raised so high that each confrontation or revelation generates as much (or more) genuine suspense as anything found in Hollywood's latest thriller-of-the-week.",285
Secrets & Lies,"There may not be a whole lot of plot to it, but what's there is emotionally engaging, and performed by a remarkable ensemble.",285
Secrets & Lies,"Secrets and Lies is a beautifully constructed sentimental melodrama, with none of the rough edges that Mike Leigh has insisted on in the past.",285
Secrets & Lies,"In the hands of another director, it would have been a sentimental melodrama, a soap opera, but with nuanced writing and sharp helming, Mike Leigh mixes humor and pathos in equal measure.",285
"English Patient, The","... a 'Casablanca' for the 90s, directed with sweep, elegance, and grand passions by Anthony Minghella from his screenplay adaptation of Michael Ondaatje’s novel.",286
"English Patient, The","...from sweeping vistas, incredible performances, and one incredible score, Anthony Minghella’s The English Patient is one of the most beautiful films...",286
"English Patient, The","The rich complexity of Minghella's approach finds an incomparable balance between classical storytelling and a modern formal treatment, and therein realizes one of the most enduring, beloved, and unique romances ever to come out of Hollywood.",286
"English Patient, The","Much like the patient's memories, The English Patient swirls around in your head, refusing to recede, its images lingering like snatches of a fragrance too sweet to be forgotten.",286
"English Patient, The","Epically romantic stuff, with a welcome dose of modernism mixed up in an intriguing mystery.",286
"English Patient, The","If Minghella's debut feature Truly, Madly, Deeply was overrated -- a Ghost for the NW3 set -- this movie is a quantum leap towards cinema's potential for magic.",286
"English Patient, The",You can take your brain to The English Patient and you will not be insulted. Your eyes will not be offended either. This scarcely makes Minghella's film the best in the world; it just makes it loom large.,286
"English Patient, The","Whenever the movie's design seems too elaborate, too remote, it's the rare detail of these performances that redeems it.",286
"English Patient, The","Minghella doesn't so much adapt the novel as he translates it wondrously to a different medium, with its mysteries and passions intact.",286
"English Patient, The","...a deliberate, lengthy but always fascinating film...",286
Marvin's Room,"Zaks knows enough not to get in the way of his three superb stars, who put on a display of emotional fireworks that is lovely to behold.",287
Marvin's Room,"Great work from Dicaprio, De Niro, and especially Streep certainly make the film watchable, but it still can't save it from feeling like a TV movie of the week. If you're a fan of melodrama... and over 60, then you'll find much to like.",287
Marvin's Room,"Keaton is given a rare opportunity here to remind us that she's not simply a fine comedienne, and she's marvelous.",287
Marvin's Room,"At times attractive, at other times dull.",287
Marvin's Room,The performances are overwhelmed by cinematography so gorgeous and distracting it makes the drama seem like just so much wheel spinning.,287
Marvin's Room,"It's all plinky-plink pianos and mewing oboes, trying to jerk those tears a little too hard. No, a lot too hard. The music is awful. Stupendously bad.",287
Marvin's Room,"Based on a play by Scott McPherson's who died of AIDS, it's impossible to watch the well-acted film (particularly Diane Keaton, who should get an Oscar nod) without thinking of its themees: the various approaches to love and the strength of family bonds",287
Marvin's Room,Streep gives her most credible blue-collar performance to date; Keaton sidesteps saintliness to mix vulnerability and small heroics.,287
Marvin's Room,"Its an actor's/writer's movie, but, oh, what acting and writing",287
Marvin's Room,"Slow, depressing family drama finely acted",287
Scream,"In every way, Scream VI is an improvement from its limp predecessor. Using the franchise’s prolonged nature to its advantage, rather than treating it as an elephant in the room, Radio Silence finally injects real honest-to-god new blood into Scream.",288
Scream,Scream VI stands out in every way from the other Scream sequels that came before it.,288
Scream,"It's not that there isn't gas left in the tank of the franchise, there could definitely be more done exploring how violence breeds violence but this film feels so beholden to what came before that the twists don't feel so shocking.",288
Scream,The latest instalment in the Scream franchise pays tribute to the lore of Ghostface with a thrilling screenplay.,288
Scream,... A scary and profoundly fun continuation of the saga that takes it in a new direction without neglecting its legacy. [Full review in Spanish],288
Scream,"Scream VI retains the tongue in cheek jabs at itself and the horror/slasher genre that many believe the original Scream revitalized so many years ago, while also keeping the gore and kill count high.",288
Scream,"Scream VI is empty calories that takes its dynastic roots and squanders them. Super fans will have moments of joy and recognition, but they will soon be dulled when they realise that’s all they are getting.",288
Scream,The most brutal and thrilling Scream film yet. It's at its best when it focuses on doing something new with Ghostface.,288
Scream,“VI” has much to offer for old-school fans and newcomers alike; it’s the most brutal and freshest sequel to date.,288
Scream,"As a series it creaks and strains, but as an individual film there are more than a few highlights to keep the fanbase satisfied",288
Evita,"In the end, Madonna’s performance helps save Evita from being the irrelevancy it might have been and transforms it, instead, into something very much alive and strangely moving.",289
Evita,"After all the painstaking verisimilitude the movie neglects its characters. Evita the woman shrinks. It's the background we react to-especially the crowd, with its power to applaud or boo.",289
Evita,"All in all, Evita is worth your time and money.",289
Evita,"No matter how great all the constituent elements were, [it couldn't] survive the kind of stiff, wholly artificial and forced performance that Madonna gives.",289
Evita,"A pretty much ideal big-screen adaptation of the material, which becomes convincingly cinematic. [Blu-ray]",289
Evita,"Webber's music is hauntingly original and effective, while Rice's lyrics manage to convey the information that's missing without a standard narrative and scenic construction, while also incorporating a constant sense of interpretation.",289
Evita,"At a time when songs showcased in movies were being shot as MTV music videos, leave it to director Alan Parker (The Commitments, Fame) to offer a full-blooded musical with epic elegance on its mind.",289
Evita,"It's just a sluggish, contradictory mess, a drably ""realistic"" Latin-revolution music video driven by a soundtrack of mediocre '70s rock.",289
Evita,I doubt any director could have made a good movie from Andrew Lloyd Webber's baffling and shallow musical.,289
Evita,It is quite possible to hate Cats and deplore Sex and still enjoy this movie.,289
Fierce Creatures,Some funny moments peppered with lots of sexual innuendo.,290
Fierce Creatures,Chock full of wacky misunderstandings and bawdy innuendo...,290
Fierce Creatures,A sporadically funny but very confused follow-up to A Fish Called Wanda.,290
Fierce Creatures,"If you disliked ""Wanda"", you'll loathe this!",290
Fierce Creatures,Pretty funny semi-sequel to A Fish Called Wanda.,290
Fierce Creatures,"It has little of the wit and none of the bite of ""A Fish Called Wanda.""",290
Fierce Creatures,close nut no banana,290
Fierce Creatures,Rollercoaster ride of comic pranks.,290
Fierce Creatures,"A misguided, neverending bellyflop of a film.",290
Fierce Creatures,"It's a pale imitation of ""Wanda,"" but still fairly packed with giggles.",290
Absolute Power,"A Clint Eastwood film that lays out the ingredients for a well-made political thriller, but its lack of intrigue and calculated effect throws the mix into an unfinished sketch. [Full review in Spanish]",291
Absolute Power,"Eastwood the director sets a pace so poky that grannies with walkers seem fleet in comparison. Of course, this makes the many plot holes and implausibilities all the more evident...",291
Absolute Power,"Clint Eastwood as producer-director-star strikes out in a rather slack thriller that oddly recalls a couple of Hitchcock's lesser movies, To Catch a Thief and Topaz.",291
Absolute Power,Absolute Power is... fresh out of the clichés that reduce most thrillers to formula.,291
Absolute Power,"Credibility is the main casualty of the piece, but William Goldman's taut script is well realised by thoughtful direction and the high-calibre cast.",291
Absolute Power,"""Absolute Power"" is appealingly untrendy: no car chases, no explosions, no nubile strippers. There isn't even a single character in the movie under 30.",291
Absolute Power,"An ingenious, taut thriller beset with narrative gaps and unconvincing moments.",291
Absolute Power,"""Absolute Power"" is not a ""must-see."" But if you're looking for a well-made, grown-up movie, it's worth your time and money.",291
Absolute Power,"Absolute Power is one of those evil-in-high-places thrillers that hums along nicely while the crimes are being committed, and sputters while they're being solved.",291
Absolute Power,"It's more effective than expected - aside from the scenes of excessive sex and violence, that is - mainly because Eastwood gives one of the most deeply felt performances of his career.",291
Rosewood,"Undoubtedly a great movie could have been made of this still unhealed scab on the body politic. But ""Rosewood,"" John Singleton's film of these events, isn't it.",292
Rosewood,"Singleton's main goal is the vivid re-creation of mob violence, and he achieves it expertly.",292
Rosewood,Singleton's boldness is invigorating _ and merciless.,292
Rosewood,The fact that Rosewood takes time to understand its demons is an uncommon touch for any film that addresses such an inflammatory topic.,292
Rosewood,"A unique and shining example of telling the stories of our past that need to be told, lest their lessons be lost forever.",292
Rosewood,"Harrowing this may be, but the concessions to commercialism rob it of much of its genuine power.",292
Rosewood,Action-packed historical drama; some violence.,292
Rosewood,"America has not truly dealt with the race massacres that happened far too often early in the 20th century, and this filmmaker, aware of that, did his part to raise awareness.",292
Rosewood,Singleton brings the images and underlying psychological truths of American racial violence to the screen with a brute dramatic force that few directors have matched.,292
Rosewood,"At its best, Rosewood touches a still-raw nerve.",292
Donnie Brasco,"A fine film, though not quite a classic, mostly because it didn't break any ground, or show us a new way of telling this type of story (25th anniversary)",293
Donnie Brasco,"A clever insight into the everyday, professional banalities of life as a low to mid-level gangster.",293
Donnie Brasco,"This is Depp's coming-of-age role, and he's terrific. Pacino, who's shown more flash than substance recently, reminds us how great he can be when he loses himself inside a character.",293
Donnie Brasco,"Depp's tight, guarded performance is almost painful to watch, and Newell seems to have reined in the flamboyant Pacino, whose portrait of the mobster as a grumpy old man may be his best work in years.",293
Donnie Brasco,"It's tempting to think Pacino stopped trying sometime in the mid-1980s. But watch Lefty's elegiac final scene and you might conclude that it's not Al's ability that's dimmed, rather it's the imagination of casting directors that's grown stale.",293
Donnie Brasco,"Although perhaps familiar in its outer trappings, Pacino's fine work is the key to the film succeeding to the extent that it does.",293
Donnie Brasco,[Newell and Attanasio] pay as much attention to emotional details as to the clockwork details of mob life.,293
Donnie Brasco,Just misses ranking in the upper echelon of mob movies.,293
Donnie Brasco,"A tense, sharp and compelling character study, Newell's film is a worthy addition to the Mob-movie canon.",293
Donnie Brasco,A classy piece of work that may disappoint those looking for something more conventional.,293
Liar Liar,"Its not just Carrey as a comedic performer that makes this movie so enjoyable, its him as a very flawed, but very loving, father.",294
Liar Liar,There are several moments of inspired lunacy on full display.,294
Liar Liar,"...a briskly-paced comedy that relies heavily on Carrey's unabashedly (and occasionally overbearingly) broad performance to propel the thin, overly familiar narrative forward...",294
Liar Liar,Jim Carrey is hilarious in this film,294
Liar Liar,One of the best comedies of the '90s and one of Carrey's most enduring (and endearing) works.,294
Liar Liar,"Carrey, unique among American stars, doesn't need story or writing to delight. He needs only room, and ""Liar, Liar"" gives him plenty.",294
Liar Liar,"Carrey fans the world over should rejoice at the squidgy-faced one's return to form -- this is quite possibly his best, most consistently funny film yet.",294
Liar Liar,"Carrey's frenzied physical and vocal contortions provide lots of amusing comic moments, as well as a few riotous ones, and the role is not only tailor-made for his rubber-faced antics but also gives him an opportunity to show a more human side.",294
Liar Liar,"Despite being way, way, way (way) over-the-top at times, Liar Liar is vintage Jim Carrey and a nice return to form. Honestly.",294
Liar Liar,"This is essentially a one-joke movie, but it's a nifty joke.",294
Breakdown,"Its simplicity is striking, and because the central premise is wholly believable, the sensational and impossible aspects become equally genuine as the film goes along.",295
Breakdown,"Clocking in at roughly ninety minutes, Mostow's film plays like a gritty yet glossy entry into the universally relatable Ordinary Person in Extraordinary Peril subgenre",295
Breakdown,A turbo-charged thriller.,295
Breakdown,"Despite a few hiccups, Breakdown is a solid movie and Paramount Pictures made a very good choice adding to their Paramount Presents collection.",295
Breakdown,Breakdown is a 90s thriller through and through.,295
Breakdown,"Dabbles in a few horror movie tricks and actioner clichés that weaken the momentum, but it nonetheless refuses to lose all of its steam.",295
Breakdown,"Sometimes a tightly wound watch - with a little bit of filigree and flourish to set it apart - is all you need. The sort of low-and-slow simmer that Blumhouse might now push into 1,000 theaters at best.",295
Breakdown,"Although Breakdown certainly resembles a compacted version of George Sluizer's Americanized remake of his 1988 Dutch/French psychothriller, it actually owes a lot more to The Hitcher in terms of tone, atmosphere, and execution.",295
Breakdown,...one of the most effective and flat-out engrossing thrillers within recent cinematic history...,295
Breakdown,A first-rate nail-biter that packs more genuine white-knuckle moments into 100 minutes than a dozen overpriced volcano movies could ever dream of having.,295
"Promesse, La",Penn has accommodated himself to the political and artistic status quo in an unfortunate manner.,296
"Promesse, La","Penn intrinsically understands that there can be no epiphanies nor catharsis, as important portents and clues go unanswered as Black drifts into the mire of his obsession.",296
"Promesse, La","It's ""one last ride"" for our leading character Jerry Black (Nicholson), until he abandons the case and retires. It examines a man trying to relinquish his deduction instincts in exchange for a slippery grip on a 'normal' life.",296
"Promesse, La",[Penn] sustains a mesmerizing intensity while relentlessly building toward an emotionally wrenching climax.,296
"Promesse, La","Sean Penn's agonizing, angst-ridden ""The Pledge"" feels like a mystery less about murder and more about the inexplicable dangers of impulse and guilt. It's also a waning opportunity to see Jack Nicholson as anything besides a silver-haired hornball.",296
"Promesse, La",Its grip is on the mind but not the heart--a problem for a film that clearly aims for some emotional impact.,296
"Promesse, La","Nicholson rules over ""The Pledge"" with a shaky hand, and that's the source of his power here.",296
"Promesse, La","After two honorable failures, Sean Penn makes quantum leap forward with an intriguing murder mystery that's also effective as a psychological character study. Nicholosn's riveting turn compensates for deliberate pacing and downbeat tone.",296
"Promesse, La","Penn shows restraint and patience, letting the actors discover moments, rhythms, and quirks that make their characters believable.",296
"Promesse, La","É uma pena que nem todos tenham paciência para tentar compreender melhor Jerry Black. Tenho certeza de que, no futuro, este será lembrado como um dos personagens mais marcantes da bela carreira de Jack Nicholson.",296
Ulee's Gold,Peter Fonda delivers the performance of his career in this excellent indie hit.,297

Face/Off,"In John Woo’s Face/Off, the unhinged intensity of the actors’ performances and outlandish absurdity of its plot is matched only by the relentless excess of its action.",298
Face/Off,"In a time when the action genre seems to struggle to find its identity, it says something that the 27-year-old “Face/Off” still holds up against much of what passes for action cinema today.",298
Face/Off,Face/Off's action sequences are classic Woo with bullets flying every which way and plethora of guns to go around.,298
Face/Off,"Utterly preposterous, but, boy, does this baby deliver!",298
Face/Off,Face/Off immediately dials in on the operatic lunacy of its two leading men.,298
Face/Off,"The movie more than just pure spectacle, the tremendous cast and engaging story putting Face/Off a couple of notches above your typical 1990s action fare.",298
Face/Off,Why have a bunch of scenes in which a boring person does boring things when every single instant of a film can be just completely raving bonkers?,298
Face/Off,"[John] Woo fills the screen with one show-stopping set-piece after another, bringing a poetic grace to the action freakout with sweeping camerawork and sophisticate editing.",298
Face/Off,Face/Off might be over-the-top as a cat-and-mouse action film but Woo directs both Travolta and Cage to some of the best performances in their career.,298
Face/Off,"Redeemed by Woo’s bravura skills, Face/Off becomes more than just a genre exercise.",298

Air Force One,The midair mayhem never lets up in a stunt-filled thriller that's brimming with nasty villains and daring deeds.,300
Air Force One,An entertaining thrill ride...,300
Air Force One,Air Force One ultimately isn’t so much “Die Hard on a plane” (Fly Hard?) as much as it’s a Top Gun for grown-ups -- military hardware in the service of a red-white-and-blue chest thumper.,300
Air Force One,"It’s tense and exciting in direction, the scripting is solid so that everything just flows with natural tension-breakers, and the performances are engaging whether as leads or supporting.",300
Air Force One,Predictable and full of the usual terrorist tactics. It's two hours of tense drama and intense brutality.,300
Air Force One,[Wolfgang Petersen] turned this sky-high silliness into a top-flight popcorn movie.,300

Air Force One,"God bless Wolfgang Petersen for mounting such a thrilling, phenomenally stupid-yet-surprisingly deep studio blockbuster at a time where we need way more of that than Spider-Man 7.",300

In & Out,"During a decade in which gay-themed mainstream movies were about as threatening to hetero audiences as a Care Bears cartoon (Philadelphia, The Birdcage, etc.), here’s another to join the crowd.",301
In & Out,The film’s tameness isn’t necessarily to its detriment as farce.,301
In & Out,"The great strength of In & Out is in individual moments more than the grand narrative arc, and if some of the attitudes on display are outdated today, that’s a hazard for any movie not written today (including Philadelphia).",301
In & Out,"It’s not anywhere near perfect, but there’s still a lot to like about In and Out...",301
In & Out,An amiable and wickedly funny comedy.,301
In & Out,"The comedy is at its peak in this delicious, stylistic film.",301
In & Out,"A quick-moving romp that tackles the toxicity of homophobia with refreshing levity, In & Out is a great reminder that stories about repressed queer trauma can still be utterly hilarious.",301
In & Out,"Buoyed by Paul Rudnick's loopiest screenplay to date and a fizzy all-star ensemble led by Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack, In & Out may be one of the four or five truly funny studio comedies since Some Like It Hot.",301
In & Out,Not always that amusingly.,301
In & Out,...an often painfully broad comedy that's rarely as entertaining (or as funny) as one might've anticipated.,301

L.A. Confidential,The best and richest crime-cop drama in decades... This is an instant classic.,302
L.A. Confidential,"One of the best cop films, L.A. films, and 1950s-set films. It’s also the best movie most of its cast and crew have ever been associated with. (25th anniversary)",302
L.A. Confidential,"Darker than piping hot coffee and more hard-boiled than a picnic egg, here's a colourfully brutal, thriller which might have been hewn from Hollywoods golden heyday.",302
L.A. Confidential,A masterfully smart and soulful film that bows low before genre even as it betrays it.,302
L.A. Confidential,"Danny DeVito plays vile Sid for more laughs than such a sleazy type deserves, while Kim Basinger portrays a woman disappointed by life but still hopeful for salvation.",302
L.A. Confidential,"The ensemble cast is flawless, anchored by two intense young Aussies, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce.",302

Fly Away Home,It feels like a believable family unit.,304
Fly Away Home,"No better children's film has appeared all year, but my bet is it'll be the grown-ups, not the kids, who come away with a lump in the throat.",304
Fly Away Home,"Thrilling, touching adventure for animal lovers.",304
Fly Away Home,"The dynamic between Daniels' vigorous, if self-involved, artist father and Paquin's initially sullen, eventually self-discovering teenager is warmly and believably conveyed, with both thesps doing strongly individualistic work.",304
Fly Away Home,"Fly Away Home is, quite simply, a beautiful movie. Not just because of its cinematography ... but because of the strong, subtle performances of Anna Paquin and Jeff Daniels.",304
Fly Away Home,"Anna Paquin proves again what an expressive, soulful actress she is, and Daniels' madcap dad is a winning study in hippy ingenuity and indefatigability.",304
Fly Away Home,A lovely and unjustly forgotten family film.,304
Fly Away Home,Somehow makes the story of orphaned geese entertaining.,304
Fly Away Home,"Fly Away Home lacks the visual splendor (probably because of budget) of The Black Stallion or the emotional force of Born Free but it is, nonetheless, a welcome addition to the sparse genre.",304
"Ice Storm, The","Even while nailing a specific period in time, it’s still able to transcend its setting and speak directly to modern folks who no longer find aesthetic pleasure in impossibly long sideburns.",305
"Ice Storm, The","In fact, just about everything sexual that happens in the film is dirty, unpleasant, unsatisfying, and led to pain and heartbreak for just about everyone involved (25th anniversary)",305
"Ice Storm, The","The Ice Storm contains a deeply human authenticity and willingness to portray, but not resolve, its characters' collective alienation.",305
"Ice Storm, The",Family life -- the real focus of The Ice Storm -- is rendered as having something like the alienating density of prison; each solitary feels enclosed in his or her own sentence and injustice.,305
"Ice Storm, The",The film's smartly told through the eyes of the children...,305
"Ice Storm, The","The key to The Ice Storm's ambiguity and unexpected depth is that the events of the story mean wholly different things to different characters -- there's no moral, just life sliced like a loaf of bread.",305
"Ice Storm, The","Elegantly directed by Sense and Sensibility's Ang Lee, it frames the moral vacuity of the Seventies with cool, contemporary hindsight.",305
"Ice Storm, The","Nothing less than one of the year's best pictures, a portrait of wealthy Connecticut suburbanites in the 1970s whose lives have no emotional or spiritual rudder.",305
"Ice Storm, The","The Ice Storm captures this place, this season, this garish and confused moment in history, with surgical precision...It's Lee's sympathetic detachment that gives the movie its paradoxical power.",305
"Ice Storm, The","Among its many virtues, 'The Ice Storm' keenly captures the sheer, visceral terror of puberty-of grappling with these urges, trying to do what you think you're supposed to, and lashing out when you can't.",305

Mrs. Brown,terrific performances make it a must-see,306
Mrs. Brown,Fine Judi Dench starring drama.,306
Mrs. Brown,"Centering on a lesser-known chapter in the reign of Queen Victoria, this richly detailed drama about her intimate relationship with her servant that scandalized the country is extremely well-acted; Judi Dench deserves an Oscar nomination",306
Mrs. Brown,"Dench is magnificent as Victoria, a toy-sized, black-suited, dough girl of despair, a woman slowly recovering her wits and her expectations.",306
Mrs. Brown,This discreet drama failed to get to me emotionally.,306
"Devil's Advocate, The","Helped by some very snappy dialogue, Pacino makes The Devil's Advocate his own.",307
"Devil's Advocate, The",Devil's Advocate possesses such assets and problems that many will be divided in whether to applaud it for its witless audacity or chastise it for its contemptuous treatment of its audience.,307
"Devil's Advocate, The","Self-indulgent and overlong, it suffers largely due to Reeves having to carry the narrative momentum. Pacino is clearly having an absolute blast, but he seems to be in an entirely different movie from the rest of the cast.",307
"Devil's Advocate, The",Outrageously entertaining.,307
"Devil's Advocate, The","Although Pacino’s wily and delicious performance eventually leads to an over-the-top climax that threatens to derail the entire picture, The Devil’s Advocate develops patiently and effectively over 143 minutes.",307
"Devil's Advocate, The","It's circular and disjointed and over the top, but as a comedy it can be fun -- especially when we observe Pacino's rantings.",307
"Devil's Advocate, The","Despite the film trying to take itself seriously, I’ve laughed my ass off every time I’ve watched it over the years (25th anniversary)",307
"Devil's Advocate, The",At half its present length it might make an OK midnight camp item.,307

"Devil's Advocate, The","You don't care about any of the characters, so there's no fear of something nasty happening to them, and, with the exception of Pacino (who plays the devil himself), it's terribly miscast.",307

FairyTale: A True Story,A sugared but poignant account...,308

"Rainmaker, The","Happily this time people will discover our hometown boy Matt Damon, who gives a superb lead performance in an unfortunately mediocre property.",310
"Rainmaker, The",This David-and-Goliath story is helped along by newcomer Damon's charming performance and a cast that includes quirky performances.,310
"Rainmaker, The","This effort shows no sign of a halt to the decline of Coppola, a film-maker who, in the 1970s, was producing towering achievements such as the first two Godfather movies and The Conversation.",310
"Rainmaker, The","The Rainmaker is a formulaic potboiler, decently acted, notably by Mickey Rourke... and Jon Voight.",310
"Rainmaker, The","The style of direction is relatively impersonal, but Coppola gets the job done, making the most of the Memphis locations and letting humor and compassion flourish; the film's unforced sympathy for the underprivileged is one of its biggest pleasures.",310
"Rainmaker, The",The great director Francis Ford Coppola takes a John Grisham novel and shows us and directors of other Grisham adaptations how things should be done.,310
"Rainmaker, The",Coppola turns this sow’s ear into more of a functional handbag with gaudily attractive decorations.,310
"Rainmaker, The","With its fair share of southern charm and old school filmmaking ingredients, ""The Rainmaker"" floats like morning mist compared to the thunder-and-lightning storms of other Grisham films.",310
"Rainmaker, The",What The Rainmaker lacks in nuance or originality it makes up for by serving as cinematic comfort food.,310
"Rainmaker, The",[I]t's the stellar performances from the cast that make this quiet little film such a rewarding watch.,310
"Wings of the Dove, The",This adaptation of one of Henry James’s most psychologically rich novels works on its own lighter terms -- although those terms arguably rip away the very forces that motivate the James characters.,311
"Wings of the Dove, The","Sensuous, intelligent and moving, this is one of the best of the year.",311
"Wings of the Dove, The","The film, however, keeps your interest and Bonham Carter makes you feel her lust and pain so easily that hers is one of the finest performances of the year.",311
"Wings of the Dove, The","The problem is that once you posit an atmosphere of relative lubricity, most of the tension in the story disappears. Who in this movie would care if Kate carried on a torrid affair with Merton Densher?",311
"Wings of the Dove, The",All of this intrigue is played out against the most romantic of backgrounds.,311
"Wings of the Dove, The","Instead of piling on distracting historical details and background, Dove trusts the audience to notice behavioral clues and fill in the blanks.",311
"Wings of the Dove, The",The Wings of the Dove flies high in a year when a whole lot of mega-buck movies barely got off the ground. It's exquisite -- and very adult -- entertainment.,311
"Wings of the Dove, The",The problem is this: We're given no reason to care about these two yearning hearts. Our only evidence of their love is a garish display of hormones.,311
"Wings of the Dove, The",Visually stunning? Absolutely! But I found the film's plodding pace relentlessly annoying.,311
"Wings of the Dove, The",This compelling drama reveals the havoc wrought by those who try to control other people's lives.,311
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"This thriller set in Savannah, Georgia, has enough juicy intrigue to recommend it. But it's got some fault-line flaws that director Clint Eastwood ignores to weave his local-color tapestry.",312
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"No dominant sense of style, no evocation of classic Southern charm or presence of a Gothic sensibility. This one meanders for more than two hours and we emerge tired and unfulfilled.",312
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"Not quite among Eastwood’s best, but a very entertaining and well-made courtroom drama with some unexpected personality.",312
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"Crisp characterisations make Midnight a pleasant pastime, although when it's over, you're not really sure what it was all about.",312
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,The one crucial miscasting is Eastwood as director. He approaches the story like a tourist.,312
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"The picture has a smoky, laid-back style that suits it during quieter moments yet feels out of place when the piece's more spiritually tinged escapades are front and center.",312
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,Seems like alchemy in reverse - a golden property is turned into lead.,312
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"Spacey, the best reason to see ""Midnight,"" gives his usual suave, effortless performance.",312
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,I think Clint Eastwood's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a great movie.,312
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"Overlong and clumsy, but compelling.",312

Titanic,"Cameron is skilled at creating successful films that often perform exceptionally well at the box office, and Titanic was no exception.",313
Titanic,"An awe-inspiring, life-changing love — the kind, perhaps, worth boarding the Titanic for.",313
Titanic,Still my second favourite film of all time. A masterpiece.,313
Titanic,"The fact that we're still talking about Titanic over 25 years after its release speaks to the film and ship's staying power. Some issues with the fictional love story not withstanding, Titanic remains an epic achievement in filmmaking.",313
Titanic,As colossal as the ship itself.,313
Titanic,"Technically very good and with great visual achievements, but, in the end, it's a cheesy, fluffy narration full of meringue that doesn't satisfy. [Full review in Spanish]",313
Titanic,"Revisiting the iconic film was a blissful experience, which holds up against the test of time.",313
Titanic,"Intimate and personal in a manner belying its scale, James Cameron’s work on Titanic holds up as well as ever.",313
3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain,"It's not that 3 Ninjas is a bad series -- in the right hands it found its perfect pitch of fun, funny, and thrilling action adventure for kids. 1995's 3 Ninjas: Knuckle Up is the series' peak. High Noon at Mega Mountain is the pits.",314
3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain,Only small children with limited attention spans will be impressed by the lackluster kung-foolishness,314
3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain,"Abrasively loud, gratingly acted, appallingly directed and without a moral core, this ""3 Ninjas"" also boasts a screenplay with the most ""Unhhhs"" of the decade, that exquisite sound you make when trying to anihilate another human with your foot or a karate",314
3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain,Things are in a pretty sad state when Hulk Hogan gives a movie's most touching performance.,314
3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain,The franchise is losing altitude fast.,314

As Good As It Gets,"Despite seemingly being given pretty much free rein to ham things up mercilessly, he [Jack Nicholson] shines without ever becoming too much.",316
As Good As It Gets,A charming romantic comedy that will make you laugh and feel good. Excellent performances all around.,316
As Good As It Gets,"James L. Brooks’ screenplay is fantastic, we are in their lives, it feels as if we are PART of their lives and watching it from right up close.",316
As Good As It Gets,"As Good As It Gets features a masterclass in writing, directing, and acting while reminding us that people can grow and evolve in their lives.",316
As Good As It Gets,"Did this really need to be 138 minutes long? Aside from that, this is a reasonably entertaining comedy that allows Jack Nicholson to amuse himself (and us) for most of the running time.",316
As Good As It Gets,One cannot exaggerate how much Helen Hunt's work invests us in this film and its characters; not just Carol but everybody else with whom she comes into contact.,316
As Good As It Gets,"With terrific lead performances by Jack Nicholson as a demonic novelist and Helen Hunt as a Manhattan waitress, As Good as It Gets is as good as mature adult entertainment gets on the silver screen.",316
As Good As It Gets,This is the stuff of formula but director James L. Brooks and co-writer Mark Andrus elevate it with terrific writing.,316
As Good As It Gets,"On one hand, it's Brooks's film that most betrays his TV sitcom roots; it's also one of his more ambitious works, packing in subplots and subjects by the handful-indicative of a filmmaker who seems to genuinely struggle with the confines of the genre.",316

In the Name of the Father,"In The Name Of The Father is a gritty, compelling and engrossing film. Day-Lewis is extraordinary, of course.",317
In the Name of the Father,Jim Sheridan tells his gripping tale with a fury that stokes up an audience the way early Costa Gavras movies used to do.,317
In the Name of the Father,Daniel Day-Lewis is remarkable.,317
In the Name of the Father,"In the Name of the Father is a model of this kind of engaged, enraged filmmaking, a politically charged Fugitive that uses one of the most celebrated cases of recent British history to steamroller an audience with the power of rousing, polemical cinema.",317
In the Name of the Father,"At every point, Day-Lewis is at the center of the story, and he carries the film with an impassioned performance. It helps that it's a great part.",317
In the Name of the Father,"The picture turns into a kind of stylized morality play about the right and the wrong ways for Irishmen to respond to distorted portraits of their character, and it's terrifically effective.",317
In the Name of the Father,"In the Name of the Father is a deeply stirring film that lessens the moral authority of the I.R.A., English soldiers in Ireland, the British police and the British government.",317
In the Name of the Father,"Day-Lewis, so intricately repressed in The Age of Innocence, here offers a role reversal in an unreserved and emotional performance that throws caution and inhibition to the winds.",317
In the Name of the Father,"If Sheridan didn't feel the need to pile on the pedantic subtexts, this would be an absorbing personal drama, rather than a vituperative, question-begging broadside.",317
In the Name of the Father,The complicated relationship between the rebellious Gerry and the quietly tormented Giuseppe is one focus of the film. The obvious political implications of the dreadful situation are another.,317
Schindler's List,The story of Oskar Schindler is as complicated as it is riveting and Steve Zaillian’s script tells us the story in a way World War II films never had.,318
Schindler's List,"It brought the Holocaust to a mass non-Jewish audience at a time when survivors were dying of old age, and testimony was at risk of being lost.",318
Schindler's List,"Spielberg employs all the emotive Hollywood tools at his disposal and the result is a remarkable film with wide appeal and real importance. Neeson is phenomenal, but matched by towering performances from Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes.",318
Schindler's List,"A great film, a powerful film, and even if it’s not the definitive American Holocaust film, it remains on the very short list of the most important ones. (30th anniversary)",318
Schindler's List,"This isn't your high-octane thriller; rather, acts of heroism unfold with a deliberate, strategic cadence.",318
Schindler's List,Spielberg’s most personal film is also his finest and most altruistic.,318

Schindler's List,Schindler's List is not only a masterpiece but something of a miracle.,318
Schindler's List,A film of immense power and the deepest sincerity.,318
Schindler's List,"Steven Spielberg's triumphant Schindler's List is a remarkable and moving memorial to an historical Holocaust. It is also a timely reminder of what genocide and ""ethnic cleansing"" really mean. But, above all, it is a cracking movie.",318

Everyone Says I Love You,Magical experiment from Woody Allen.,319
Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills,"Both a chronicle of death and retribution and, as the title suggests, a portrait of the American dream gone gamy.",320
Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills,"As a dispassionate portrait of an America where the Devil is still a credible force, and everyone seems corrupt, the film does not just expose horror. It delivers viewers into a garden of evil, and forces them to choose their own demons.",320
Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills,What a sad commentary on humanity and the flawed justice system it relies on.,320
Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills,"In light of the recent freedom of the 3 victims of a 20th century witch trial depicted in the film, this powerful documentary becomes essential viewing.",320

Mother,"Like Rose as a flatmate, it's a little too much in a small space. Not that the wretchedness of Rose’s life can or should be avoided or ignored: Full marks to Serraille and Lengronne for making her mark.",321
Mother,"Without shouting any issues loudly, the film makes provocative comments about the nature of identity, security and what's really important in life.",321
Mother,[A] beguiling but frustrating family drama.,321
Mother,"It’s a deeply intimate exploration of belonging and brotherhood which is made all the better thanks to the phenomenal performances from the entire cast, each of whom feels completely natural in their respective role.",321
Mother,"The film doesn’t want to pass judgment on the topic of frantic dating while mothering, and thanks to Lengronne’s enigmatic performance, she carries us along while we wait, largely in vain, for the story to gather steam.",321
Mother,Filled with strong sentiment but without sentimentality.,321
Mother,This heart-wrenching French drama is epic in storytelling scope and laser-focused on the most minute emotional shifts of its deeply sympathetic characters.,321
Mother,"The film is a bit too loosely structured for its own good. In numerous scenes, however, it creates poignant, truthful moments of family drama.",321
Mother,Mother and Son is a terribly sad and moving story of the destruction of a family -- and perhaps its rebuilding in a different form.,321
Mother,"Un petit frère, accurately reflects the triangulated structure of the narrative which passes like a baton from character to character, building a nuanced portrait of familial love but also of neglect and pain.",321

Dante's Peak,It's refreshing to see Pierce Brosnan out of the tuxedo and spy universe and still carry a blockbuster.,323
Dante's Peak,Dante's Peak might take some liberties with the science but the film remains an edge-of-your-seat thriller 25 years after its release.,323
Dante's Peak,Volcano erupts violently and destroys town; intense peril.,323
Dante's Peak,...a perfectly serviceable disaster flick...,323
Dante's Peak,"The new movie Dante's Peak displays all the elements of the classic Hollywood disaster flick, circa 1975 Irwin Allen (with stomach-turning dialogue to match).",323

Dante's Peak,It's refreshing to see Pierce Brosnan out of the tuxedo and spy universe and still carry a blockbuster.,323
Lost Highway,"Lynch's surreal masterpiece is infused with film noir conventions and characters, real world ties to true crime, and a fantastic dual performance by Patricia Arquette. Rarely has inky blackness ever looked so simultaneously romantic and terrifying.",324
Lost Highway,"It’s a metaphysical mystery that defies literal explanation yet has a weird and haunting emotional and thematic logic to it, like a dream or a nightmare.",324
Lost Highway,"Lynch, always in style, pushes the boundaries of what is unexpected and what really is down the road. Patricia Arquette, Robert Blake, and Balthazar Getty also star in this postmodern noir.",324
Lost Highway,Peels away the pulp trappings and runs almost entirely on film noir’s foundational fears.,324
Lost Highway,Creates a vivid and infernal dreamscape which will drill its way into your psyche.,324
Lost Highway,"It travels, without deviating, through the darkest labyrinthine highways of alienation, sex and murder, in which the most unexpected situations of domestic horror are parked on the road as an act of surreal escape. [Full review in Spanish]",324
Lost Highway,"Like a warm bath in silty water, it’s enjoyable both because and despite one’s being a mite queasy about just what’s in that murk.",324
Lost Highway,"Lynch brings the movie’s febrile and violent artifice to life in visual compositions of a poised, painterly authority and interrupts them with quick bursts of hallucinatory frenzy.",324
Lost Highway,"Behind Mulholland Drive and Blue Velvet, it's probably my favorite David Lynch film.",324
Lost Highway,"Justifiably off-putting in its simple but nonetheless jarring narrative disorientation, Lost Highway is hardly the empty, superficial exercise it was written off as.",324
Crash,"Crash is a bit too on the nose as it addresses racial tensions without much subtlety. The score, cinematography, and acting are all pretty outstanding, but it isn’t enough to save the tone-deaf Crash from feeling extremely contrived and overbearing.",325
Crash,"Hampered by unrealistic dialogue and unpleasant characters, it delivers its portrayal of a world that needs changing in the most aggressive and obvious way possible.",325
Crash,The overall feeling is that the project is adamant about absolving the social system of blame.,325
Crash,"The idea that every protagonist must eventually depend on an antagonist for help is a bit too much to digest, even when the cast is as large and exceptional as this one.",325
Crash,"What makes Haggis' film so relevant now is the gray areas it plumbs, the degrees and deep-seeded complexity of racism and its downstream effects.",325
Crash,This isn't a film for everyone. Crash demands your attention and really makes you think. It's a special film that is clearly among the best I have seen this year.,325
Crash,"Thought provoking, compelling, intelligent, coherently crafted and reality based and laced. Look for Paul Haggis and his cast of characters to be on everyone's lips come Oscar 2006.",325
Crash,It's told with a searing panache that comes to a boil as characters are forced to confront their own prejudices.,325
Crash,Issues are raised and confronted head-on and prejudices are revealed simultaneously as the movie deftly assembles its intricately plotted narrative jigsaw.,325
Crash,"Outside of the excellent cast doing their best in impossible situations, there's virtually nothing enjoyable or aesthetically admirable here.",325
G.I. Jane,G.I. Jane provides an entertaining couple of hours and represents a worthy timepiece.,326
G.I. Jane,...an erratically-paced yet mostly rewarding endeavor...,326
G.I. Jane,"According to former SEAL Rorke Denver, there are seven different types of Navy SEAL: 1) Smurf SEAL 2) Rough-upbringing SEAL 3) Brawler SEAL 4) Proto SEAL 5) Gamer SEAL 6) Ivy League SEAL 7) Legacy SEAL. Maybe Female SEAL will be the 8th type.",326
G.I. Jane,"A few decent action scenes are not enough to salvage a bad, somewhat corny performance by Moore.",326
G.I. Jane,"G.I. Jane feels somewhat ham-fisted and quaint now, but the electric chemistry between the actors and the importance of its message can still be felt today.",326
G.I. Jane,"I'm happy to see Demi Moore do well. Despite her porcelain-doll looks, she is one tough broad who's struggled long and hard for her success. But, despite its gender equality theme, G.I. Jane is not the kind of movie I want to see her score big with.",326
G.I. Jane,"You should applaud the message but boo the messenger, Demi Moore, an omnipresent force perpetually and unashamedly flaunting her gigantic celebrity and minuscule acting skills.",326
G.I. Jane,"A rabid piece of militaristic pulp with a crucial and commercially shrewd difference: The hero, the soft clay to be molded into a steely instrument of death, is a woman.",326
G.I. Jane,"From 1997, a movie that explores whether a woman has the grit, the strength and the nerve to survive Navy SEAL training, with a bald Demi Moore sweating, swearing, smoking cigars and fighting in head-to-head combat to prove that she can.",326
G.I. Jane,Unrealistic execution of an intriguing idea - a woman in the Navy SEALS. Moore is intimidating - and built! Viggo Mortensen gives an excellent early performance.,326
Cop Land,"Cop Land, with its powerhouse cast and script, remains an underappreciated genre piece.",327
Cop Land,“Cop Land” is an interesting film that allows its flaws to overwhelm it in the end while never realizing its full potential.,327
Cop Land,While the movie has its flaws -- the plot can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a detective mystery or an organized crime drama -- what has aged well is Stallone's foray into making himself vulnerable as the meek and cowardly Freddy.,327
Cop Land,"'Cop Land', James Mangold's second film in the director's chair, has an intrigue that keeps me hooked at all times with its plot about police corruption. [Full review in Spanish]",327
Cop Land,Stallone's character is interesting and easy to root for,327
Cop Land,"A haunting and decidedly downbeat police drama, Cop Land marks one of the few times anyone could see fit to sing Sly's praises.",327
Cop Land,James Mangold says that his goal was to mix elements of a grand urban crime drama a la Goodfellas with westerns like High Noon. My opinion? He succeeded in spades.,327
Cop Land,"'Cop Land' holds up as a pretty good little thriller, a Sidney Lumet movie in a Martin Scorsese movie's clothing.",327
Cop Land,"Top acting honors go to Ray Liotta as Gary Figgis, a cokehead cop who just might be Freddy's only friend.",327
Cop Land,"not your traditional action flick, nor your traditional cop flick. It has elements of each, all wrapped up in a new type of story that drips in realism and gray characters.",327
Conspiracy Theory,Drollness tinges the panic and irreverence that go hand in hand with Mel Gibson; he plays crazy incredibly well.,328
Conspiracy Theory,Conspiracy Theory is the smartest thriller of the summer.,328
Conspiracy Theory,...a marginally engrossing thriller that ultimately comes off as something of a disappointment...,328
Conspiracy Theory,Two-thirds of a fine comedy of paranoia.,328
Conspiracy Theory,"Donner directs with an efficient hand. He keeps the action moving briskly. But most important for this format, he knows how to slip in a quick joke or two without detracting from the tension of the suspenseful plot.",328
Conspiracy Theory,About a truth seeker who has a difficult time figuring out who to trust in a world where everyone seems to be playing multiple roles.,328
Conspiracy Theory,"If you've ever questioned Gibson's appeal, this serio-comic thriller offers 135 minutes of persuasive evidence as to why he's become one of the world's most reliable box-office draws.",328
Conspiracy Theory,The film starts to sour after 20 minutes...,328
Conspiracy Theory,"...even at two hours and 15 minutes, Conspiracy Theory is fast-paced and exciting, effectively mixing drama, comedy, ingenuity, suspense, revelation and a heartening sense of a triumph of humanity.",328
Conspiracy Theory,"Parece que se tornou uma especialidade de Hollywood transformar idias boas, criativas, em filmes de perseguio constante.",328
Desperate Measures,Desperate Measures has recovered its momentum to ultimately confirm its place as an erratically-paced yet predominantly entertaining thriller.,329
Desperate Measures,"""Desperate Measures"" is a drawn-out, and purely disposable, suspense thriller.",329
Desperate Measures,"Primarily, the movie works as a showcase for Garcia and Keaton.",329
Desperate Measures,A preposterous yet entertaining thriller with Michael Keaton stretching admirably as a Hannibal Lecter-style killer.,329
Desperate Measures,A waste of time.,329
Desperate Measures,A squandered opportunity to explore important issues through popular moviemaking.,329
Desperate Measures,Keaton and Garcia have never been any more desperate than in this silly film.,329
Desperate Measures,an astoundingly inept thriller that's easily the worst movie ever directed by Barbet Schroeder and may well prove to be an all-time low for everyone else involved with it.,329
Desperate Measures,"uma pena que este seja um filme de ao. A premissa do filme to forte e bem armada que, com certeza, poderia ter gerado uma histria muito mais dramtica e complexa.",329
Desperate Measures,So intent on keeping the action cresting that the credibility of the narrative is often undermined.,329
Kiss the Girls,"Good lead performances, a stylish production and atmospheric visuals, make the so-so thriller watchable for the undemanding viewer.",332
Kiss the Girls,"Given the lack of mystery in what is supposed to be a mystery, Kiss the Girls partially succeeds simply because of the two central performances.",332
Kiss the Girls,"Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd both deserve better than this mediocre, muddled, dark and only at times engrossing psychodrama.",332
Kiss the Girls,...a mostly entertaining yet thoroughly by-the-numbers thriller...,332
Kiss the Girls,"The tension is genuine and the crimes frightening, though the editing occasionally opts for flashy style over fitting artistry.",332
Kiss the Girls,A thrill-less thriller. Too violent for kids.,332
Kiss the Girls,There is a critical void in the middle--the villain.,332
Kiss the Girls,"like a good-looking blind date who promises dinner and a movie, then takes you to Burger King and ""Wishmaster,"" the spell dissipates quickly, leaving you feeling seduced and abandoned.",332
Kiss the Girls,"Em nenhum momento o espectador fica grudado cadeira, em pnico pelo que pode acontecer dali a alguns minutos.",332
Kiss the Girls,"Freeman and Judd are so good, you almost wish they'd decided not to make a thriller at all -- had simply found a way to construct a drama exploring their personalities.",332
"Game, The",‘Dangerous Game: The Legacy Murders’ is neither dangerous enough to provide the thrill it promises nor does it have what it takes to leave the legacy for its mindless murders.,333
"Game, The","This gory, nasty murder mystery skims over the mystery part and collapses into a thunderstorm of hateful shouting.",333
"Game, The","Dangerous Game: The Legacy Murders is an amalgamation of movies that came before, like Saw and Ready Or Not. The movie throws everything at the wall, hoping something sticks, but all we're left with is a mess.",333
"Game, The","Too over the top. Too chaotic. Too much of a ""Knives Out"" lookalike.",333
"Game, The","At its worst, Dangerous Game: The Legacy Murders is an ugly and nasty movie, but even at the low bar of its relative best, it's just incompetent.",333
"Game, The","Not helping the cause is McNamara, the helmer of “Cats & Dogs 3: Paws Unite,” who isn’t a seasoned genre director, but a guy known for grinding out inexpensive features quickly, living up to his reputation with his latest B-movie.",333
"Game, The","There are some gnarly kills but overall it is a predictable mess of a movie. For better or worse, the killer comes off as a Jigsaw wannabee, forcing the family to play their game.",333
U Turn,"The more outsized the performances the more fun the film, and while Penn is refreshingly less mannered than usual, it's the scenery-chewers who carry the picture.",334
U Turn,"This is a knowing, sophisticate's view of film noir: mannered, heartless, kitsch.",334
U Turn,In essence this is potboiler stuff. But it is a positive relief to find the director of Natural Born Killers in holiday mood.,334
U Turn,Those who have learnt to distrust this director will hardly be surprised to learn that here is a film giving murder a bad name.,334
U Turn,"Filmmaker Oliver Stone has infused U Turn with exactly the sort of over-the-top, less-than-subtle vibe one might've anticipated...",334
U Turn,"The best art of any age typically comes from the dysfunctional artist, and U-Turn is just that -- Stone's oddball glimpse into a shadow America that no one wants to believe exists but that undoubtedly does.",334
U Turn,"With the exception of 1988's lacerating Talk Radio, U Turn might be the most forgotten film in Oliver Stone's canon -- a shame, since it offers sinful pleasures for those willing to take the ride.",334
U Turn,"As the first Oliver Stone movie to gleefully dispense with sociopolitical significance, U-Turn is an overdue event, a chance for Stone to apply his hypnotic acid-trip-of-the-soul wizardry to something sexy and lowdown.",334
U Turn,"It's a feast for the senses, as long as you have a strong stomach.",334
U Turn,The stylistic fun Stone has in dramatizing this crime of passion thoroughly revitalizes the well-worked genre.,334
How to Be a Player,The rap-heavy soundtrack is the real point. But at least it has jokes.,335
How to Be a Player,"The sexual politics of this shrill, dim-witted yarn would have looked passé in the blaxploitation films of the early 1970s.",335
How to Be a Player,"These reflections are illuminating, but the gags don't venture beyond crassness.",335
How to Be a Player,[An] infantile sex comedy.,335
How to Be a Player,An inept sexist comedy.,335
How to Be a Player,This one hurt...and they did not do women right in these movies...,335
How to Be a Player,"Very much mistaken, and I now realize the error of my ways...just the way this was played, and the overall themes...",335
How to Be a Player,"I watched the whole movie and am still not a ""player."" Therefore the film is a failure. Plus it's also pretty awful.",335
How to Be a Player,"Riddled with misogyny, glorifying slovenliness and brutish behavior, Def Jam's How to Be a Player doesn't even begin to come up with the nasty laughs of a Booty Call or Sprung.",335
Playing God,Playing God's fun is because the film is not what you think and will surprise you at how excellent and heartfelt the real story is.,336
Playing God,"Mildly engaging, clunky, uneven and shallow.",336
Playing God,"What doesn't work on a logic level makes sense according to the characters and performances. And the twists - a con movie always has twists - are quite satisfying, even if you see them coming.",336
Playing God,"That this is wrapped within a tale concerning the holiest of fathers Himself is certainly a clever maneuver, if not a bit too obvious.",336
Playing God,"The very flimsy premise of Playing God is bloated into 95 minutes of tedious and uninspired repetition, with dull acting and empty characters. It's ironic that this vapid comedy, which tries to use spirituality as a punchline, actually has no soul.",336
Playing God,"It's always watchable, but it's never lively enough to be gripping, and its more serious messages are lost in the shuffle.",336
Playing God,"A story about con artists but with a fresh, new perspective.",336
Playing God,"Worth checking out if you're in the mood for something original, thoughtful, and different.",336
Playing God,"There is a bigger suspension of belief needed than usual for a movie about con artists, but Alan Tudyk's performance makes this a worthwhile watch.",336
Playing God,"[Playing God is] this week's episode of 'Good Actors, Less Than Ideal Script.'",336
"House of Yes, The","""The House of Yes'' is a comedy. And a pretty funny one, too.",337
"House of Yes, The","Unless you think drawing-room re-enactments of JFK's assassination beat Pictionary as a party game, it's best to say no to the achingly arch comic satire The House of Yes.",337
"House of Yes, The",Incest is the core of dysfunctional family dramedy.,337
"House of Yes, The","Bujold has the frazzled hauteur of an aging, neglected star, and Spelling is nicely glazed, studiously artless. But the film is keyed to Posey's performance: perfectly brittle, faultlessly false.",337
"House of Yes, The","Bujold is as good as ever, but the real surprise here is Spelling: Slack-jawed and dewy-eyed, lids forever at half-mast, she's perfectly cast as a lamb among wolves, and her naivete is strangely affecting.",337
"House of Yes, The","[Waters] manages to open up the text while maintaining its perilous mix of arch wit, pathos and suspense.",337
"House of Yes, The",A fierce piece of farce and sharp as a kitchen knife.,337
"House of Yes, The","Offers more than its share of tartly biting zingers, dropped to maximum comic effect by the letter-perfect Posey.",337
"House of Yes, The","There's something quite lethal about Parker Posey in pearls, and for that inspiration director Mark Waters deserves our gratitude.",337
"House of Yes, The","So light it almost floats away were it not somewhat anchored by the performances of Posey, Bujold and Spelling.",337
Bean,"Occasionally it's funny, but mostly it's immature and idiotic.",338
Bean,"It has become readily apparent that it is, indeed, the time to say goodbye to this once delightfully different character.",338
Bean,The English release this week is as asinine as its Bollywood cousin.,338
Bean,The film will appeal to Mr. Bean fans and to families looking for an amusing afternoon at the movies.,338
Bean,"Mr. Bean's Holiday is not a great film, it has its moments, but it offers an odd type of comfort.",338
Bean,"The flick itself is quite funny... if you like Mr. Bean, that is.",338
Bean,"Mr. Bean's Holiday is a film stuck in the wrong century, more akin to classic silent comedy than modern humor and Bean himself is a clown caught without his make-up, psychedelically colored pants and bright red nose.",338
Bean,"Mr. Bean's Holiday delivers some of the charm of the original series, and whatever it may lack, it is worth watching simply for Rowan Atkinson's dedicated performance.",338
Bean,Britain's most-beloved mute behaving like a buffoon while vacationing in France.,338
Bean,"Slight, slapstick-heavy comedy will amuse kids.",338
Mad City,Mad City is an example of every thing that is wrong with sensational journalism.,339
Mad City,A movie so narratively threadbare that its idea of cutting-edge topicality is to have Larry King and Jay Leno pop up as themselves to comment on the proceedings.,339
Mad City,"A drama too timid to tackle its media machinations or manipulations with thoughtful talk. Dustin Hoffman is fine. John Travolta resembles the SNL version of Wolverine. Ultimately, it's a 2-7 off-suit hand bluffing an ace in the hole.",339
Mad City,Mad City is a waste of your time and money.,339
Mad City,This simplistic and obvious expose about the manipulative power of the news media (lazily acted by Travoilta and Hoffman) is so familiar that it's not going to upset or provoke anyone.,339
Mad City,"...a film of mild pleasures and mild annoyances, alternately tired and clever yet ultimately dismissible.",339
Mad City,"'The media are vultures' is the prevailing point here, and it is not expressed in the most original or interesting of ways.",339
Mad City,"Compelling analysis of the modern media. Somewhat obvious, but still works.",339

Mad City,Mad City is an example of every thing that is wrong with sensational journalism.,339
Boogie Nights,"Pornography, drugs and disco are the driving forces of this potent parable of the partying 1970s from director Paul Thomas Anderson.",340
Boogie Nights,"It's so complex in its apparent simplicity... the film presents the opportunity to be examined from different levels from many sides. If you haven't seen it yet, I'm jealous. [Full review in Spanish]",340
Boogie Nights,A boldly original and superbly entertaining portrait of the porn industry.,340
Boogie Nights,"Made in the shadow of Paul Verhoeven’s much-maligned Showgirls, even a quarter-of-a-century on Boogie Nights is an evocative, provocative triumph.",340
Boogie Nights,"In a world of impossibly muscled-up studs and busty bombshells, the deliberately schleppy Scotty stands out as the film’s beating heart.",340
Boogie Nights,Philip Seymour Hoffman is a standout in a movie chock-full of standouts.,340
Boogie Nights,"Rarely, if ever, has any filmmaker depicted the void with so much sparkle and wit.",340
Boogie Nights,...there is enough brilliance-including a drugs-and-guns showdown that outdoes Tarantino-to make it worth sticking around for the end of the party. And nothing could be truer to the Seventies than a party that goes on too long.,340
Boogie Nights,"A beautifully made survey of '70s excess, filtered through the trashy world of the burgeoning porno film industry in southern California.",340
Boogie Nights,"It is remarkable that [Seymour Hoffman] was able to stand out-it's packed with great performances from some of the best of the best: Don Cheadle, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy, Heather Graham, and, of course, Burt Reynolds.",340
Critical Care,There's not much that's subtle in Lumet's tirade against the greed of the medical profession and health-care system and patients who sue.,341
Critical Care,"...it emerges as a magically entertaining blend of heart, soul, mind, wit, farce and, finally, an idyllic idealism.",341
Critical Care,"The film is a stimulating mix of a medical drama and a courtroom showdown, with broad comedy from Brooks, a little sexual blackmail, and a touching subplot involving another terminally ill patient who thinks he is being visited by the devil.",341
Critical Care,...a drily funny satire about America's health care woes...,341
Critical Care,...the performances are juicy and intelligent.,341
Critical Care,"Lumet moves with confidence between satire and intriguing, heightened-reality spirituality.",341
"Man Who Knew Too Little, The",An hour and a half of unsophisticated satire.,342
"Man Who Knew Too Little, The","Murray, not playing mean streak for once, is on his best comic form in years, but unfortunately this is a one joke movie and Too Little does not go a long way.",342
"Man Who Knew Too Little, The",A plain caper comedy which [Bill Murray] singlehandedly elevates into a goofy gem.,342
"Man Who Knew Too Little, The","In this attempt to revive Bill Murray's dwindling career as a leading man, dumb humor is the order of the day.",342
"Man Who Knew Too Little, The","This plot wheeze may have passed muster 50 years ago, but is not viable on the threshold of the new millennium. The more the situation is elaborated, the more strained and outdated the jokes appear.",342
"Man Who Knew Too Little, The","Aside from all the fitting silliness that embellishes the storyline, the conclusion is an absolute mess.",342
"Man Who Knew Too Little, The",...a misguided and terminally unfunny disaster that's rarely as appealing or entertaining as star Bill Murray's typically charismatic performance.,342
"Man Who Knew Too Little, The","You have to be a Bill Murray fan, or in an especially generous mood, to find ""The Man Who Knew Too Little"" more than mildly amusing.",342
"Man Who Knew Too Little, The",This is the kind of thing Murray and Amiel could do in their sleep. So they do.,342
"Man Who Knew Too Little, The","After a decade or so of lackluster, what-were-they-thinking? movies, Murray has finally come back to himself",342
Alien: Resurrection,[A] missed opportunity.,343
Alien: Resurrection,"Let's see: It's a big improvement over No. 3, not as good as No. 2 but on a par with or slightly better than No. 1. Anything else you want to know about Alien Resurrection?",343
Alien: Resurrection,"Alien Resurrection checks in with enough slime, gore and scary monster-flick moments to satisfy undemanding audiences. But it's an ugly, animated corpse of a movie stitched together from the other three films in the series.",343
Alien: Resurrection,[A] cold but sufficiently nightmarish and high-powered proof that there's life in the old franchise yet.,343
Alien: Resurrection,"A wonderfully contradictory film -- it's trashy, brutal, viciously ironic and highly imaginative.",343
Alien: Resurrection,"The sardonic bits work, but there's none of the old grandeur and depth, and not much horror either. The smell of evil is missing.",343
Alien: Resurrection,"The fourth in the Alien series is the slimiest, the funniest and the most perverse -- which is to say, bring it on!",343
Alien: Resurrection,"Alien Resurrection displays flashes of glum beauty, scary power and carefully titrated humor before the whole grisly thing turns to gibberish... It's time for Ripley to retire.",343
Alien: Resurrection,The sense of mystery and anticipation that defined Ridley Scott's original Alien here dissolves into a series of more or less overt encounters with no more poetry or suspense than an evening of professional wrestling.,343
Alien: Resurrection,"Alien Resurrection is just so wild, entertaining, and ambitious compared to Alien 3, and the subsequent sequels, I have to applaud it...",343
"Apostle, The","Instead of reducing his minister to an Elmer Gantry hypocrite, Duvall gives us a flawed man who nevertheless has a deep, loving religious conviction. This is the finest movie ever made about a minister or priest.",344
"Apostle, The","If you can stand to sit for two hours and listen to a sermon and really want to see Robert Duvall’s performance by all means go see it, but if you’re not as patient as I tried to be this is not the film for you.",344
"Apostle, The",Duvall's script is one of subtle grace and beauty.,344
"Apostle, The",Duvall is effortlessly mesmerizing in the lead role...,344
"Apostle, The","Shocking in its unbridled, electrifying energy and raw emotion.",344
"Apostle, The",I cannot recall a movie so dominated by the performance of one actor (Robert Duvall) as this one.,344
"Apostle, The","Some kind of acting miracle ... One doesn't have to be a churchgoer, or even a Christian, to be moved by the power of Duvall's great performance.",344
"Apostle, The","A labor of love coming to fruition after 13 years, this is Robert Duvall's third and best directorial effort, a sharply observed exploration of a preacher who embarks on a redemption odyssey after committing a crime.",344
"Apostle, The","... may be the most unapologetic, intimate portrayal of a religious man in the history of American cinema.",344
"Apostle, The","As the charismatic Sonny, Duvall brilliantly shouts the praises of Jesus.",344
Deconstructing Harry,A monstrously funny middle finger of a movie.,345
Deconstructing Harry,"A reminder of a time when Woody Allen made films that were forces of energy, bundles of fun, and bubbling with ideas, ingenuity and a real surplus of humour.",345
Deconstructing Harry,Certain echoes from Allen's own tabloid ferment get channeled through bombastic speakers here.,345
Deconstructing Harry,"In this nasty, verbose comedy, Woody Allen the director has cast Woody Allen the actor as a foul-mouthed, self-absorbed, sex-obsessed writer.",345
Deconstructing Harry,Too bad it is difficult to really care about what is going on since such a thoroughly unpleasant character is at the center.,345
Deconstructing Harry,"Deconstructing Harry is abrasive, complex, lacerating and self-revelatory. It's also very funny, most of the time.",345
Deconstructing Harry,Woody Allen's most foul-mouthed effort to date . . .,345
Deconstructing Harry,A slightly unpleasant and shocking film.,345
Deconstructing Harry,"By turns clever, devestating, bitter and delightful, this challenging piece of work is easily one of Allen's most mature efforts to date.",345
Deconstructing Harry,"Woody Allen no s um cineasta de extrema cultura e de um timing cmico irrepreensvel. Ele , antes de tudo, um dos mais talentosos roteiristas que o Cinema j produziu.",345
Jackie Brown,... A beautifully modulated portrait of the limits and the last resorts of middle age.,346
Jackie Brown,"Even though this film pushes past two-and-a-half hours, the forward direction of the plot keeps things moving with minimal repeat. This movie exudes coolness on every level.",346
Jackie Brown,"While Jackie Brown does revel in nostalgia and feature its fair share of firearms, it’s a much more subdued, nuanced and mature film than any of Tarantino’s previous works, or any other production within his entire filmography.",346
Jackie Brown,"Jackie Brown is an outstanding drama, and is the film I believe to be Quentin Tarantino’s most lasting masterpiece.",346
Jackie Brown,There’s something magical about seeing talent like Forster and Grier getting to light up after so many years of Hollywood keeping them in the cellar.,346
Jackie Brown,"To enjoy this you have to be into it for the kicks. It baits us, but does not completely reel us in.",346
Jackie Brown,Pam Grier and Robert Forster turn in some of the best performances of 1997 in Jackie Brown.,346
Jackie Brown,"Tarantino’s use of multiple angles for the same scene to show different perspectives spread throughout a short period of time is similar to that in Pulp Fiction and isn’t new, but is still effective.",346
Jackie Brown,"It's a long, occasionally ponderous, but compellingly stylish and witty film, with a marvellous soundtrack and a top-notch supporting cast...",346
Jackie Brown,Maybe posterity will crown Jackie Brown as his best film and maybe not. Either way it shows that mainstream plotting and noir romance are yet more movie styles that Tarantino can fabricate: brilliantly.,346
Wag the Dog,"The idea sags near the end, but for some time, it is right on.",347
Wag the Dog,...I’ll simply let the movie explain itself and recommend it highly for anyone interested in satirical filmmaking.,347
Wag the Dog,...a vitriolic comedy/satire that venomously assesses the lack of morality in the modern media and politics...,347
Wag the Dog,Perhaps what's so surprising about 1997's Wag the Dog is how the political satire feels so realistic over twenty years following its theatrical release.,347
Wag the Dog,...a fairly static drama that contains few elements worth connecting to or wholeheartedly embracing...,347
Wag the Dog,"If anything, in the years since its release, the worlds of politics, entertainment, and news media have grown even more intertwined in which narratives are carefully controlled and expectations are minimal.",347
Wag the Dog,"'Wag the Dog,' a movie that's fun to see more than once, comes across as a bitingly funny satire of politics, the media and show business.",347
Wag the Dog,"Entertaining, creepily resonant political comedy.",347
Wag the Dog,Smart political satire from director Barry Levinson.,347
Wag the Dog,"Anyone who would be inherently interested in this kind of sendup is unlikely to be surprised by anything in this film -- overall it feels like a trifle, if an entertaining one.",347
Desperate Measures,Desperate Measures has recovered its momentum to ultimately confirm its place as an erratically-paced yet predominantly entertaining thriller.,348
Desperate Measures,"""Desperate Measures"" is a drawn-out, and purely disposable, suspense thriller.",348
Desperate Measures,"Primarily, the movie works as a showcase for Garcia and Keaton.",348
Desperate Measures,A preposterous yet entertaining thriller with Michael Keaton stretching admirably as a Hannibal Lecter-style killer.,348
Desperate Measures,A waste of time.,348
Desperate Measures,A squandered opportunity to explore important issues through popular moviemaking.,348
Desperate Measures,Keaton and Garcia have never been any more desperate than in this silly film.,348
Desperate Measures,an astoundingly inept thriller that's easily the worst movie ever directed by Barbet Schroeder and may well prove to be an all-time low for everyone else involved with it.,348
Desperate Measures,"uma pena que este seja um filme de ao. A premissa do filme to forte e bem armada que, com certeza, poderia ter gerado uma histria muito mais dramtica e complexa.",348
Desperate Measures,So intent on keeping the action cresting that the credibility of the narrative is often undermined.,348
Hard Rain,The first candidate for one of the worst films of 1998.,349
Hard Rain,"A sharply photographed, sparkling little thriller, full of appropriate slow-motion, exciting confrontations in unique settings, and a rip-roaring climax.",349
Hard Rain,"In terms of pure visuals, I loved this film.",349
Hard Rain,Hard Rain is pure water torture.,349
Hard Rain,It impresses because of the way it makes the flood look so vital to the narrative.,349
Hard Rain,"It's big, dumb, noisy, and teeming with idiotic dialogue, yet the finished feature has a certain merry swagger about it that keeps everything motoring right along, and the hook of the film is immaculately presented.",349
Hard Rain,"Virtually nothing that takes place here is believable for a moment, beginning with the idea that all these people would expend all their energies trying to shoot one another when they are so imperiled to begin with.",349
Hard Rain,You know you're in trouble when Betty White (denture wearer...Rogaine needer) is the big scene-stealer.,349
Hard Rain,"The flood rises, the night grows murky, and it becomes clear that the more water there is on screen, the less room there is for anything of interest to happen.",349
Hard Rain,"Hard Rain may not be the most inventive of thriller plots, essentially boiling down to an extended chase with all concerned after the moneybags, but it's extremely impressive as a physical production.",349
Fallen,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is an extremely flawed film that re-hashes the same shots and didn't know where to take it's story...,350
Fallen,"Bay finds every reason and no reason at all to blow stuff up real good, proving once again why he should be directing energy drinks commercials and music videos, but not motion pictures.",350
Fallen,"Arguably the worst film in the series, it's the celluloid equivalent of a 150-minute waterboarding session.",350
Fallen,"Some of the flaws are easier to overlook than others, especially with the nearly indescribable amount of mayhem exploding across the screen.",350
Fallen,It's big. It's obnoxious. It's way too long. It's downright overwhelming.,350
Fallen,There's lots of 'booms' and 'pows' ... it simply does not end ... exactly like the first ... but they did it all again.,350
Fallen,"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen may not be a great piece of cinema, but it works as a piece of visually impressive yet utterly mindless popcorn fodder.",350
Fallen,"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen always promised to be bigger, louder and more Michael Bay than before, and it's certainly all of those things.",350
Fallen,"Despite being overloaded with a boatload of problems, this follow-up to the 2007 hit manages to work for one simple reason - it gives fans of the original exactly what they want to see, plenty of explosions and action.",350
Fallen,"The first Transformers worked. Inexplicably, it turns out. The second Transformers doesn't. Inevitably, it turns out.",350
"Prophecy II, The","If you thought The Prophecy was a fluke, it was.",351
"Prophecy II, The",Worth it only for the Walken moments...A comedown from the original,351
"Prophecy II, The",Best in the series. Good creepy fun.,351
Spice World,"The girls themselves sometimes have a chemistry, but are normally annoying paper-thin characters, but still quite fun.",352
Spice World,"The film would do well to trust the girls, who have great fun playing caricatures, rather than padding the film with a series of unconnected cameos. The result is a madcap, but often overwhelming comedy.",352
Spice World,I was struck by how well it stands up-the pacing is better than you'd expect-and also how fantastical it is...,352
Spice World,"There's great stuff in here for sure...but it's almost there, which is frustrating, because it's a bit too muddied and doesn't; have a through line.",352
Spice World,"A gem of a movie. It attempts a lot in terms of satire, but it is much more edited and selective in its approach.",352
Spice World,"Little more than an excuse to exploit the success of the Spice Girls, this feature is a grossly lacking project, even for those who enjoy the music.",352
Spice World,"A bizarre artefact that captures the sheer oddness of the Spice Girls' rampant hold on the British (and indeed, global) consciousness for a couple of years after 1996.",352
Spice World,Exceedingly silly yet generally entertaining...,352
Spice World,Can the Spice Girls act beyond their assigned personas? World doesn't stop spinning long enough to answer.,352
Spice World,This film barely manages to tell a story at all.,352
Deep Rising,Deep Rising earns it cult status with good gore and inventive kills.,353
Deep Rising,Tremors meets Titanic in this cheesy but entertaining sea-monster movie from director Stephen Sommers.,353
Deep Rising,"Whether Deep Rising was merely a stand-alone horror film pummeled at the box, or a galaxy-brained stealth prequel for a monster franchise that failed...there's one axiom that still holds true: They don’t make B-movies like they used to.",353
Deep Rising,"It's a peak American 1990s action film, boasting numerous explosions, jet skis, New Gilded Age hubris, uneasy racial politics, anxieties about computer technology, surveillance, and state-of-the-art digital effects by Industrial Light and Magic.",353
Deep Rising,"Ya gotta give a sliver of credit to any movie that would include the term ""Half-Digested Billy"" in its closing credits.",353
Deep Rising,It's man-eating tentacles on a boat directed by Stephen Sommers. What more could you ask for?,353
Deep Rising,Every single line of dialogue was a one-liner and it was just every single trope.,353
Deep Rising,"One of the big problems with this film compiled out of big problems: it has awful characters, and awful performances bringing them to life.",353
Deep Rising,"For a movie with so much story and set up, it's shocking how well ""Deep Rising"" comes together.",353
Deep Rising,"The rest of the movie is a predictable guns 'n' beasts gorefest that wants to be equal parts Aliens, Titanic, and Anaconda but winds up being all parts crap.",353
"Wedding Singer, The",Sandler and Barrymore succeed in elevating The Wedding Singer as one of the better romantic comedies in the late 1990s.,354
"Wedding Singer, The","A pitch-perfect celebration of a time when male perms and Van Halen were in at the same time, 25 years after it was first released, this 1985-set comedy is perhaps still the most crowd-pleasing and entertaining 90 minutes of Adam Sandler’s career.",354
"Wedding Singer, The","…while most comedy dates fast, Frank Coraci’s simple, romantic, funny film has stood the test of changing times…",354
"Wedding Singer, The","[Drew Barrymore is] developing into a fine actress, but most of all, some of the bits will send you rolling in the aisles. This is one sweet and pleasant comedy.",354
"Wedding Singer, The",Like the entire decade of the ’80s thrown into a blender.,354
"Wedding Singer, The","So funny and charming, with some excellent cameos.",354
"Wedding Singer, The","There's some cheap nostalgia at play here (okay, maybe a lot) but it's more than made up for with genuine laughs and a ton of heart.",354
"Wedding Singer, The","Puppy charm, retro-hip and some good old-fashioned romantic chemistry lift a traditional comedy to the brighter realms of a pleasant, quirky and genuinely touching slice of matinee entertainment.",354
"Wedding Singer, The","The chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore is something special to see here, and I think 'The Wedding Singer' ends up being Sandler's best movie.",354
"Wedding Singer, The","Not the most original comedy, but many will enjoy.",354
Sphere,"An undersea, sci-fi, paranoid thriller which packs tension but cannot release the powerful payoff we have a right to expect.",355
Sphere,"Adding to the downfalls is the unavailable chemistry between the leads, Hoffman and Stone. No sparks seem to fly in this relationship and we don’t feel a kinship to either.",355
Sphere,It pays to be incredibly suspicious of a movie where nearly all dramatic tension is drawn from characters standing around bleeping computer screens and commenting on how bad things look.,355
Sphere,"I was utterly confused by the end of Sphere... This project had all the resources to make a fine film, and it squandered them all, for want of a cogent screenplay.",355
Sphere,"Ultimately, the explanation we've been waiting for turns out to be just that: an explanation.",355
Sphere,An empty shell.,355
Sphere,"Three major stars being involved, it all wraps up happily but implausibly.",355
Sphere,"The central idea for Sphere is an intriguing one, but similar concepts have been much better executed on episodes of Star Trek, which makes one wonder why movie writing is allowed to be so bad.",355
Sphere,"Word 'pointless' is the one that should be attributed to this whole film, one of the worst to come from Hollywood in past decade and one that would test patience and temper of the audience like few others.",355
Sphere,"Let's face facts: Michael Crichton is a hack. He comes up with innovative concepts, but his characters are cardboard cutouts. Given the psychological foundations of the story, that's an egregious flaw, and the ending is absurdly dissatisfying.",355
"Client, The","The film has a worthy point of view, and is willing to admit the problems of the Warren Commission, but it also proves a cold case is a cold case and dead men tell no tales.",356
"Client, The","Truth is the Only Client stands out because it actually interviews those close to the investigation rather than getting new investigators to examine the case, which tends to happen in most documentaries.",356
"Client, The","Rich in details, blissfully lacking hyperbole, this is a welcome scholarly approach to an emotional subject.",356
"Client, The",Watch this utterly riveting and important doc.,356
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest can be compared to All the President's Men or the conspiracy film Capricorn One in how it challenges the system. Low-key and understated, this film is powerful in ways that cut to the core of the human condition.",357
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,A rare screen adaptation of a beloved novel that maintains the emotional and dramatic power of the original while establishing its own distinctive approach to the story...,357
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"Adapted from Ken Kesey’s novel of the same name, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest is an electrifying observation of the need for reform in our mental institutions.",357
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,[Jack Nicholson's] certainly never been better than in this superb black comedy about life in an asylum.,357
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest is still one of the most forward-thinking and emotionally complex films about oppression and people’s rights as it relates not just to mental illness but to society as a whole.,357
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"A very young Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif all appear in great supporting roles.",357
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"It is a political film... I mean political in the sense that it is about power, about ideological tyranny, and behind its façade are all the Solzhenitsyns who didn't get out.",357
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"Every vice and virtue is explored with humour and compassion in this masterly film. Altogether, an unforgettable experience.",357
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"Under the skillful direction of Milos Forman, and with Jack Nicholson in the ""heroic"" lead, ""Cuckoo's Nest"" attains its greatest power in the medium of film.",357
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"Kesey's story was hardly designed to be naturalistic, and Forman's streamlining isn't the way to make it work (there may not be any way). As it stands, Forman has merely reduced the story without successfully revising it.",357
Spawn,"If it’s meant to snare the uninitiated, I must say it failed to hook me.",358
Spawn,"Unfortunately, as a product of the '90s, the film relies heavily on dated, primitive, terribly unconvincing computer graphics.",358
Spawn,"I would say I feel bad for a cast that's clearly above this material, but at least they got paid for it; I ended up in the red.",358
Spawn,Violent '90s apocalyptic horror tale is dreadful.,358
Spawn,"Ends up feeling like every other mid-budget comic book movie from the second half of the 1990s, and that was a uniquely dispiriting moment for such things.",358
Spawn,This barely coherent hunk of junk is like a cheap horror film with only a suggestion of the grisliness that appeals to fans of cheap horror films.,358
Spawn,Has aged about as well as a banana in the sweltering sun...,358
Spawn,"As a movie, 'Spawn' can't make up its mind what it wants to be any more than its protagonist knows who he is or what he wants to be.",358
Spawn,What it doesn't have is much of a plot.,358
Spawn,"It's simply a parade of toys and tricks, without a jot of playfulness, knowing humour or campery to endear itself.",358
"Assignment, The","Stylistically, it’s one of Hill's most accomplished works of recent years, but unfortunately a lot of that gets lost in the shuffle with the execution of its narrative.",359
"Assignment, The","While this is an assuredly mixed bag that’s not as funny as it seems to think it is, the instantly harsh first wave of reaction is way off.",359
"Assignment, The","Even moving beyond its sticky politics, The Assignment is simply a lousy film.",359
"Assignment, The","...fraught and deeply problematic, graphically violent and irredeemably stupid. Rodriguez is fine, but the reason this film sticks with you is Weaver, who has never been meaner or funnier...",359
"Assignment, The","A pulp thriller about a hitman's revenge. And at the same time, a showcase of well-known, quality actors.",359
"Assignment, The","It's a stupid movie, incompetently constructed and completely oblivious to the poor taste in which it presents the issues of gender fluidity and expression. This film is trash. Don't watch it.",359
"Assignment, The","Grindhouse groupies will have something to celebrate with the latest offering from maverick auteur Walter Hill, the simultaneously shameless, trashy, and generously entertaining The Assignment.",359
"Assignment, The","'The Assignment', with its tone changed, is a mere food product that goes from a research drama to pure and hard-acting film in its final stretch. [Full Review in Spanish]",359
"Assignment, The","It's vintage meat-and-potatoes Hill, but any sense of low-brow, comic book fun continually crashes against a concrete wall made of one-note performances and a lunkhead, monologue-heavy script.",359
"Assignment, The","The Assignment feels like a case where the audacity of the premise and the talent attached to the project kind of supercede the ultimate quality of the film, making it a must see for Hill or Weaver fans. Aside from that premise, the film struggles.",359
Wonderland,"It’s all very charming: as cosy as crumpets in front of an open fire. But the film-makers are really pushing it, by stretching out the book’s 30-odd pages into 80 minutes of screen time.",360
Wonderland,"Delightful and inventive, this Christmas animation is an enchanting throwback in both style and story.",360
Wonderland,The characters rush around spouting irritating rhymes but never do anything worth paying attention to.,360
Wonderland,"Much of the film's appeal and humour rests firmly with the under-10s bracket, but it still promises a jolly good time for any adults in the room.",360
Wonderland,The Night Before Christmas in Wonderland is a diverting charmer of a family Christmas movie. It has its moments but it’s not likely to be a classic.,360
Wonderland,"There's a real charm to the movie's look and tone, but The Night Before Christmas in Wonderland is so set in its storybook storytelling that it's just a bit too simplistic...",360
Incognito,Pretty good thriller actually.,361
Blues Brothers 2000,Skip the film and buy the soundtrack.,362
Blues Brothers 2000,"As a sequel, it is an inevitable disappointment. As a celebration of the original, staged with goodwill and love, it is a pretty enjoyable way to spend two hours.",362
Blues Brothers 2000,"Now a sequel has arrived, Blues Brothers 2000, offering more of the same. And less.",362
Blues Brothers 2000,"If viewed at this late date, it provides mostly nostalgia for the pairing of the lovable soulmates.",362
Blues Brothers 2000,"It goes without saying that Blues Brothers 2000 doesn't carry the original's significance and R-rated personality, yet select treats remain, while the soundtrack wails triumphantly.",362
Blues Brothers 2000,"The sequel offers more of the same, only less.",362
Blues Brothers 2000,Endless scenes of pointless buffoonery and crashing cars.,362
Blues Brothers 2000,There must be a niche audience for this travesty -- probably among teenagers whose hearing and mental faculties are impaired.,362
Blues Brothers 2000,"This isn't a sequel, it's a remake.",362
Blues Brothers 2000,"Another time, another planet.",362
Sudden Death,"After the success of Die Hard, it wasn’t much of a surprise to see “Die Hard on a bus” (Speed), “Die Hard on a ship"" (Under Siege), etc. But did anyone have “Die Hard at a hockey game” on their bingo card?",363
Sudden Death,"Instead of scoring with a surefire premise, ""Sudden Death"" follows the title's direction, keeling over before game even begins.",363
Sudden Death,"Tripe, but hard not to enjoy.",363
Sudden Death,An especially blatant Die Hard knockoff...,363
Sudden Death,"Good clean fun, with just the right ratio of explosions to dialogue.",363
Sudden Death,"Van Damme is at his butt-kicking best, with Sudden Death offering all the thrills, spills and stuff blowing up that action fans relish.",363
Sudden Death,"Reuniting Hyams and Van Damme, director and star of Timecop, this spectacular nail-biter exploits their combined, if limited, abilities to the full.",363
Sudden Death,The best of the many Die Hard rip-offs made during the 1990s. Sudden Death is a thrilling rollercoaster ride of hard-edged action.,363
Sudden Death,"Wooden-as-ever Van Damme is no Bruce Willis, unfunny main bad guy Powers Boothe is no Alan Rickman, and uninspired director Peter Hyams is no John McTiernan.",363
Sudden Death,Gets a lot of mileage out of the well-worn trapped-in-a-blank-full-of-hostages action genre.,363
Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,Decidedly ill-conceived and underbaked.,364
Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,Too much of a crude thing...,364
Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,Highlighted by a mechanical rhino skit (built and acquired out of thin air) that takes the cake on combining unrefined humor and laugh-out-loud unexpectedness.,364
Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,"A grown man vomit-feed a young bird in its nest, stick his head out of a rhinoceros' backside, or commit a wide variety of toilet humour-based atrocities in rapid-fire succession.",364
Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,A surprisingly awful sequel...,364
Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,"A little bit of Carrey goes a long, long way--and this Ace Ventura comedy goes on for too, too long.",364
Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,A guilty pleasure.,364
Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,"Warner Bros. doubled the budget for this sequel in 1995. For their trouble, they got half as funny a film.",364
Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,It's silly stoo-pid merriment...for any age.,364
Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,Painful to sit through.,364
Powder,"'90s sci-fi fantasy has violence, cursing.",365
Powder,"Pretentious, uninvolving headscratcher that aims to be tragic and uplifting and falls way short; the only thing it'll lift is your butt from your seat midway through the film.",365
Powder,"Okay drama, could have been more moving",365
Powder,Interesting film that's just a little too much like an expanded X Files episode,365
Powder,Offbeat drama about a mystic with strange powers and a compassionate service of others.,365
Powder,"Powder has all of the elements of a successful fantasy, and none of the insights. It's a movie where intriguing ideas lie there on the screen, jumbled and unrealized.",365
Powder,"Performed to the hilt by Flanery and filmed with conviction by Victor Salva, the movie is finally too solemn to survive its pushy musical strings.",365
Powder,"'90s sci-fi fantasy has violence, cursing.",365
Powder,"Pretentious, uninvolving headscratcher that aims to be tragic and uplifting and falls way short; the only thing it'll lift is your butt from your seat midway through the film.",365
Powder,"Okay drama, could have been more moving",365
Dangerous Minds,"Often these students seem a little too easy to tame, but on this level, Dangerous Minds is enjoyable.",366
Dangerous Minds,"If you liked Sidney Portier in To Sir With Love, this is the film for you.",366
Dangerous Minds,"[Dangerous Minds] tells a story that, frankly, we've heard before. Yet it tells that story with such piercing emotion that it seems brand new.",366
Dangerous Minds,"The film is able to overcome its faults through an uplifting finale; it may be formulaic, but the inspirational model is entirely effective.",366
Dangerous Minds,"Cliches, stereotypes, mixed messages in '90s school drama.",366
Dangerous Minds,"Movie stars have tamed sassy kids in movies from The Blackboard Jungle to Stand and Deliver, but it's hard to remember an example more patronizing or sentimentalized than this one.",366
Dangerous Minds,None of it rings the slightest bit true; all of it insults the intelligence.,366
Dangerous Minds,So whitebread I want to call everyone involved 'Urkle'.,366
Dangerous Minds,Horrible. A waste. How was this ever a hit?,366
Dangerous Minds,"Often these students seem a little too easy to tame, but on this level, Dangerous Minds is enjoyable.",366
Clueless,"With a confident irony that never robs its characters of their integrity, Heckerling takes Clueless into a realm that both comments on and inhabits the teen movie archetype, so that what’s left goes beyond the genre’s conventions and builds upon them.",367
Clueless,Overall Heckerling has perfectly captured the essence of Austen's comedy.,367
Clueless,"Adult spectators won't watch it, and the Cher's of society will never understand its irony. [Full review in Spanish]",367

Clueless,"As it is, you might just go postal over the witty lines.",367
Clueless,"One might not expect an adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma to be just so... pop. Clueless is exuberant, funny, loving, and delights in the possibilities of its title.",367
Clueless,"Writer-director Amy Heckerling has pulled off an amazing sleight-of-hand by turning a story full of vacuous, overindulged California teen-agers into a light-hearted comedy of manners.",367
Clueless,A funny but too often saccharine sweet look at Beverly Hills adolescents.,367
Clueless,This movie is satirical. And hysterical.,367
Clueless,Silverstone's read of Cher -- not to mention her overflowing cup of cuteness -- makes the character likable.,367
Bio-Dome,"Comedy is, I think, the most subjective of film genres, so I can only reflect my own opinion: Shore has a perverse talent to actively leave comedy less funny than when he found it.",368
Bio-Dome,"At one point, Pauly looks into the camera and says, ``Sometimes stupid can be pretty cool.'' Not this time, Pauly.",368
Bio-Dome,Shore captured the Razzie award for Worst Male Lead (tied with Tom Arnold) for his performance here.,368
Bio-Dome,"A psychotically unfunny and thoroughly loathsome comedy from start to finish. That said, the film earns points for never taking its foot off the pedal, and for never attempting to make the manic idiot protagonists remotely likable or even human.",368
Bio-Dome,"None of this makes any sense and the humor is poorly executed. Mostly, this is an annoying film.",368
Bio-Dome,"Despite the advances humankind has made since dragging itself out of the primordial ooze, Shore is a successful comedian.",368
Bio-Dome,"Even with the low expectations any reasonable viewer brings to a Shore flick, this rates only stupid-plus.",368
Bio-Dome,"All told, it's precisely what you'd expect -- which means you'd be well-advised to wait for the video.",368
Bio-Dome,It's not by any means inspired madness.,368
Bio-Dome,It's good for one reason: it killed Pauly Shore's career.,368
Black Sheep,"It received scathing reviews upon release, and it's certainly no masterpiece, but this broad slapstick comedy has a few good laughs and a sweetness that, in retrospect, makes it somewhat endearing.",369
Black Sheep,"may not be remembered as a masterful comedy classic, but for the college humor crowd with a relatively safe PG-13 rating, it's a fun diversion",369
Black Sheep,"It's nice to see the two together, practicing their easy screen rapport--and no doubt more so given Farley's untimely passing--but Black Sheep is still a clunker. [Blu-ray]",369
Black Sheep,painfully unfunny,369

Black Sheep,"The goofy ""Tommy Boy"" chemistry seems forced a second time around.",369
Black Sheep,"the most charming of Farley's screen efforts, but it's too bad he wasn't around long enough to make anyting better",369

Black Sheep,A transcendent comedy starring one of the top - but most tragically fated - comedy teams of all time.,369
Black Sheep,"Makes ""Tommy Boy"" look like A-grade material",369
Mary Reilly,"This isn't dumb, but it plays out as academically as it sounds, without a shred of true terror and with only the most muted sexual charge. Solemn, portentous and curiously dull, there is simply no chemical charge between Roberts and Malkovich.",370
Mary Reilly,"Certainly Julia Roberts' strangest role, and she does an OK job.",370

"Bridges of Madison County, The","With Eastwood as Kincaid and Meryl Streep as Francesca, this carefully observant love story turns Waller's pop-lit passion into screen art.",371
"Bridges of Madison County, The","Bridges is an admirable achievement, one that probably does more to reposition its maker as someone who can carry a movie without carrying a gun than as the director/star of a Love Story for the Loving Care set.",371
"Bridges of Madison County, The",Those who found Waller's book an outrageously bad read may be gratefully surprised to find less mush in the movie.,371
"Bridges of Madison County, The","Beautifully photographed and directed with an intimate maturity, the film reveals its characters in an unhurried way, thus making the audience accomplices in the unfolding liaison.",371
"Bridges of Madison County, The","The movie, thank goodness, is better than the book. What's more surprising is that The Bridges of Madison County is an accomplished piece of moviemaking.",371
Striking Distance,"The hard truth is that Bruce Willis is just one of many faces going forth here as gamely as possible. And yet for its crude and compromised stitching, ""Striking Distance"" remains weird, wobbly and eminently watchable.",397

Batman,The film creates an alluring combination of the familiar and the fresh.,403
Batman,"""The Batman"" has a somber tone different from previous versions that, due to its enunciation, bring it closer to the style of the Film-Noir film genre, returning to the original style of the comic strip and its proximity to pulp literature.",403
Batman,"When it’s all said and done, The Batman is good—not great. From technical and narrative standpoints, there are both gaps and achievements.",403
Batman,"For a film set deep in the depths of Gotham’s gritty underbelly, the script slowly descends into the chaotic silliness of the characters that it feels so desperate to shed",403
Batman,The Batman is a gritty psychological crime thriller featuring the most Gotham-esqe Gotham we’ve seen yet.,403
Batman,It’s certainly a better film than any of the Zack Snyder ones. But that’s not exactly a high bar to set.,403
Batman,"This film is beautifully gritty and simply a great detective story. It takes Batman to his roots and acknowledges the silliness of a sad, orphan boy in a rubber suit.",403
Batman,"It starts with an original vision of the hero, has an inspired cast, creates a self-sufficient story and elevates it with a stylized direction that's in line with the film's substance. [Full review in Spanish]",403
Batman,"The Batman is an ALL TIME BEST FILM. Matt Reeves has crafted the DEFINITIVE take on The Caped Crusader that Pattinson will define for generations to come. Brooding and brutal, I didn’t want it to end.",403
Batman,The Batman isn’t just another entry in a trilogy or a multi-directed Batman starring three Bruce Wayne’s. It’s a love letter to fans who have waited decades for a faithful adaptation of Batman.,403
Pinocchio,"The pacing is hopelessly unwieldly, with unnecessary deviations from the original film, added characters who don’t really have purpose and do not propel the plot, and new songs that are not up to Disney standards.",404
Pinocchio,"Robert Zemeckis’ live-action film has gorgeous, seamless animation and revels in its seductive timelessness.",404
Pinocchio,Pinocchio boasts a more thematically impactful ending than the original but fails to deliver a new version of the famous childhood tale with the same magic and allure of the past.,404
Pinocchio,The movie doesn’t spark much magic like the original film does & just is very basic..,404
Pinocchio,"For a film about a wooden boy who wants to become real and learn about what it means to be a person, Pinocchio (2022) is lifeless. Even Hanks, who has spent a good portion of his career playing charming, loveable characters, is bland in this adaptation.",404
Pinocchio,Go build your own wooden doll. Even that will be more productive than watching this Robert Zemeckis directorial.,404
Pinocchio,"The faithfulness of this film sees it play justified homage to its inspiration, although often at the expense of offering anything particularly worthy of the whole remake.",404
Pinocchio,A sparkling reimagining of the indelible 1940 Disney classic that manages to pay homage to the original — and to the 1883 Carlos Collodi story that inspired it — while also weaving new layers of magic into the proceedings.,404
Pinocchio,"Pinocchio will surely be a hit with families and will primarily be enjoyed by parents and children...However, audiences outside the target demographic will likely find this to be very surface-level and predictably average.",404
Pinocchio,They allow for some good emotional moments with a story that we've known before. Tom Hands does a good job as Geppetto & leads to the human connection to this story. Some times it feels like to much of a direct copy & doesn't boast for much rewatchability,404

Thinner,The thinner the lawyer becomes the thinner the story gets.,406
Thinner,Thinner is jaw-droppingly bad: not only weirdly amateurish but regularly offensive.,406
Thinner,A wretched excuse for a horror movie and a flat-out disgrace on every level.,406
Thinner,"Even for Stephen King's rather unsubtle style, it's pretty simple and manipulative.",406
Thinner,"Director Tom Holland's totally banal and pedestrian horror movie is the ""thinner"" end of the wedge as far as awful adaptations of King's books go.",406
Thinner,"Thinner continues in a kind of cartoony vein, almost making fun of itself as it goes along, but not exactly getting any laughs.",406
Thinner,"A constantly absorbing little chiller directed by the underrated Tom Holland (Fright Night, Child's Play).",406
Spy Hard,"Less raunchy than the other Nielsen films, the material isn't enough to sustain its 80 minutes but it has its moments.",407
Spy Hard,This spy parody from 1996 feels very much of its time.,407
Spy Hard,[A] haphazardly executed send-up.,407
Spy Hard,The result is 80 brief minutes of movie skits assembled in an order that sort of resembles a plot.,407
Spy Hard,"The movie will be of interest only to Nielsen's most devoted fans and to those who wonder why Nicollette Sheridan never made more movies, or more swimsuit calendars.",407
Spy Hard,"The jokes come in sporadic volleys rather than the steady machine-gun pace of The Naked Gun and Airplane!, and, with a few exceptions, they are less truly aimed.",407
Spy Hard,"The blockbuster action thriller genre is ripe for sending up, but this lazy effort has to go down as a miss despite the presence of spoofmeister Leslie Nielsen.",407
Spy Hard,"Sporadically funny, but never more than a sting of crude gags.",407
Spy Hard,"Yet another Leslie Nielson movie parody, targeted this time at James Bond pictures and their many spinoffs.",407
Spy Hard,"As funny as Nielsen can be, like all comic actors he still needs the quick-thinking jokes and zingy one-liners to be genuinely funny.",407

Kingpin,The combination of the overkill factor and a basic mean-spiritedness finally sinks it for me.,410

"Nutty Professor, The","As with his earlier sequels, Nutty Professor II fails because Murphy tries too hard to outdo himself all the time.",411

Vertigo,"Those eccentricities have since become accepted, defended, and loved...",479

North by Northwest,Everything comes together just right in this Alfred Hitchcock gem.,480

"Apartment, The",A screen gem that attained classic status in about as much time as it takes to comb one's hair.,481
"Apartment, The","The picture is brimming with crisp, quick one-liners and sharp dialogue – all setting up the next moment of banter. Each conversation or character interaction is an exploration of motivation and rich emotion.",481

Some Like It Hot,Some Like It Hot is arguably one of the greatest comedy movies ever made.,482
Some Like It Hot,"Some Like It Hot is a real weirdie: Wilder gets no laughs at all out of his sizzling, fast wedding of female impersonation to 1929 thrills, but, from a non-entertainment angle, his movie has a not-quite-real surface that is worth examining.",482

Casablanca,"Anyone who has seen the classic film, knows Bogart and Bergman had undeniable chemistry, which is part of what makes the movie as great as it is.",483

Casablanca,Casablanca presents us with a film of extraordinary quality. [Full review in Spanish],483
Casablanca,“Casablanca” captures and utilizes so many things well. There’s a high level of suspense. There’s a touch of humor. There is a great realization of wartime tensions. And right in the middle of it all is what may be the best romance in cinema history.,483
Casablanca,"Casablanca, in fact, is starry with talent, pictorially often lovely and directed with considerable spirit by Michael Curtiz.",483
Casablanca,"It's far from a great film, but it has a special appealingly schlocky romanticism, and you're never really pressed to take its melodramatic twists and turns seriously.",483
Casablanca,"As soon as the main titles end, you are transported into a world filled with great performances and an incredibly sophisticated screenplay that takes advantage of every emotion you can think of.",483
"Maltese Falcon, The","“The stuff that dreams are made of,” comments Spade about the elusive black bird of the title, a sentiment easily applied to this indisputable masterpiece.",484
"Maltese Falcon, The",Many people feel The Maltese Falcon is when Bogart became “Bogie”. He exuded a certain calm and cool demeanor that made guys want to grab a beer with him and made women want to date him.,484
"Maltese Falcon, The",The Maltese Falcon gives Humphrey Bogart one of his best roles while playing a pivotal role in shaping the film noir genre for years to come.,484
"Maltese Falcon, The","The film has more conversation than expected from the film’s reputation, yet only a little feels expository with the rest being a battle of wits with too many players jockeying for the prize.",484
"Maltese Falcon, The","The film moves like lightning, without ever appearing to hurry.",484
"Maltese Falcon, The",The new version of The Maltese Falcon novela is very satisfactory. [Full review in Spanish],484
"Maltese Falcon, The",The Maltese Falcon belongs with the year's superior movies of all classes. In the crime and mystery categories it makes its competitors look like the Little Peppers series.,484
"Maltese Falcon, The","The best crook film that's ever been made. Certainly it's the best I've ever seen. Because of brilliant casting, acting and direction it does what every thriller should do: thrills you genuinely and tremendously from start to finish.",484
"Maltese Falcon, The","It is a shockingly brilliant job of production, and, for its effect on the watcher, ""gripping"" is too wan a word.",484
"Maltese Falcon, The","The story is strong of itself with an unusual ending and fine acting, but it is the treatment which makes it the best thriller so far this year.",484
My Fair Lady,"Audrey Hepburn is terrific, and Rex Harrison is incomparable.",485
My Fair Lady,"My Fair Lady persists in being extraordinarily enjoyable; and George Cukor, faced with a huge complex of comedy, music, décor, stars and prestige, has on the whole managed to keep in control.",485
My Fair Lady,"Hollywood has done right by our Eliza. With My Fair Lady, they have produced a film which has success clearly stamped on every foot of celluloid.",485
My Fair Lady,"What an enchanting picture My Fair Lady turns out to be. Awash with color and sound, it does for the wide screen what the original in its pristine state did for the musical stage.",485
My Fair Lady,"Of course what everyone wants to know first is, does Audrey Hepburn make a glowing, lovely Eliza as did her predecessor, Julie Andrews? She does.",485
My Fair Lady,I've recently added My Fair Lady to my list of favorite films!,485
My Fair Lady,"Hail to My Fair Lady. Long may she reign, and may she find place on one of Prof. Higgins's towering bookshelves for the Oscar she will undoubtedly win.",485
My Fair Lady,"The truth of the matter is that, given a good production, My Fair Lady is impossible not to like; and the film is not simply a ""good production."" It is an exceedingly wise and resourceful transformation of a magnificent stage show to the screen.",485
My Fair Lady,"Two outstanding stars of the original, Rex Harrison, as Professor Henry Higgins, and Stanley Holloway, as the dust-man philosopher, Alfred Doolittle, repeat their roles with even greater persuasion.",485
My Fair Lady,"Just get yourself a ticket, for this is as nearly perfect a movie as Hollywood has ever crafted.",485
Sabrina,"Sabrina Carpenter’s Nonsense Holiday may be a 2024 version of an early-20th-century format, but it retains the same spirit of nostalgia. And after the year we just had, cozy, comforting and familiar may be just what we all need.",486
Sabrina,"The comedy is fine, the duets are fun, but it is the Carpenter charisma that keeps it all flowing nicely.",486
Sabrina,"Overall, ‘A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter’ is a vibrant, fun-filled musical treat perfect for pop enthusiasts and festive revelers alike.",486
Sabrina,"Don’t expect to add it to your yearly viewing rotation unless you’re a Carpenter megafan, nor should you expect to add these covers to your holiday playlist, but as far as 50-minute variety specials go, there have been much worse.",486

Roman Holiday,"It is purely a rom-com, filmed with warmth and style – as sweet and inconsequential as a scoop of gelato on a summer’s day.",487
Roman Holiday,I never want to see Roman Holiday again and I regret the fact that I wasted so much time on it. I might put it on a list of my top 100 least favorite films but it would never be anywhere near a list of my favorite romantic films.,487
Roman Holiday,"A rom-com colossus, and one that has been aped and emulated in everything from Notting Hill to Trainwreck to Jennifer Lopez’s recent Marry Me...",487
Roman Holiday,...a wonderful story filled with good humor and a lovely romance.,487
Roman Holiday,...a somewhat overlong and exceedingly deliberate endeavor that undeniably grows more and more absorbing as it unfolds...,487
Roman Holiday,"An utterly disarming romantic comedy. The ""Mouth of Truth"" scene is a genuine classic, but the film is packed with equally delightful interludes.",487
Roman Holiday,"Hepburn is a marvel, mixing deep pathos with a restless yearning. She also proves to be a gifted comic. I cannot praise her performance effusively enough.",487

"Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The",That gold changes the character of men who are fortunate enough to find it is the central thesis of this curiously powerful production.,519
"Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The","Unlike most studio releases of the era, the film's depiction of wretched moral depravity is not sweetened by a studio ending, where, say, the ugly impulses of greed are suppressed by a higher moral calling.",519
"Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The","Wildly unconventional for its time, it makes its A-list star a villain, there's no romantic subplot, and it's far grimmer than most movies of the age.",519
"Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The","The film is about the power of human greed. From the moment Dobbs sees that first seam of pyrite, he is obsessed...",519
"Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The","This attraction, produced by Henry Blanke, is never pretty, but it has guts and substance. And also Bogart.",519
"Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The","Aside from a dark lesson in moral corruption, the film serves as a monumental achievement in storytelling and balanced entertainment.",519
"Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The",What an incredible film.,519

"Deer Hunter, The","There’s something elemental about the movie’s boys’ adventure machismo, a primal force that overpowers Cimino’s more cartoonish flourishes.",521
"Deer Hunter, The","Michael Cimino’s tale about the physical, emotional, and psychological impacts the Vietnam War had on a group of friends remains one of film's ultimate masterpieces. Very few movies have ever captured the unsparing aftermath of war quite as devastatingly.",521
"Deer Hunter, The","... Perhaps a little cumbersome, but it’s hard not to get caught up in the film’s big, sentimental sweep.",521
"Deer Hunter, The","It grabs you by the lapel and says, ""Call me masterpiece!""... These weaknesses are The Deer Hunter's greatest strength -- because, in a year of timid moviemaking, they trumpet the film's daring to fail at being great.",521
"Deer Hunter, The","Graphic in its depictions of war and peace, honest in its capturing of human emotion, Deer Hunter is an epic that avoids political points to stress the basic needs we all share.",521
"Deer Hunter, The",Robert De Niro reclaims his title as our finest young dramatic male star in a devastating anti-war epic.,521
"Deer Hunter, The","In terms of sheer impact, this is the best movie of 1978; it restores power and urgency to the screen.",521
"Deer Hunter, The","So many of the elements are so good that it all adds up to a pity. Someone, or more than one -- writer or producers or director or editor or all -- fogged up about why this picture was being made and whether it was on the rails.",521
"Deer Hunter, The","A film to be debated and argued over seriously because it is an earnest, serious and impressive work, despite the reservations it is necessary to have about it. In a thin and evasive year, The Deer Hunter joins a thin company that aspire to greatness.",521
"Deer Hunter, The","The Deer Hunter might have been a superb document of the devastation to human lives caused by the Vietnam war... But director Michael Cimino allows the story to drag on past three hours, with endless scenes of male camaraderie and war atrocity.",521
Down by Law,"Playing like a noir-informed mashup of “Streetcar” and “The Defiant Ones,” director Jim Jarmusch’s prison-escape dramedy is aided enormously by the brilliant performances of John Lurie, Tom Waits and a scene-stealing Roberto Begnini.",522
Down by Law,"Fellow musician John Lurie and Italian actor Roberto Benigni play his cellmates Jack and Bob, and the trio do a fine job of playing people who suck up a mutual dislike to join forces and commit an imperfect crime.",522
Down by Law,Down by Law seems on occasion to be soliciting our approval.,522
Down by Law,"Jim Jarmusch's uneven but stylish comdie noire is an astute mixture of prison picture, road movie and downbeat screwball.",522
Down by Law,"Down By Law is oddly heart-warming, magnifying moments of unexpected camaraderie between kindred spirits who don't immediately ID each other as such.",522
Down by Law,"Down by Law is a delight, right down to the unexpected last scene.",522
Down by Law,"Mutual irritation merges into grudging friendship, and the wit manages to be both broad and smart, soulful and silly, subtle and raucous, all at the same time.",522
Down by Law,"Perhaps it's not what you expect from a prison movie, but Jim Jarmusch has always adhered to his own personal vision.",522
Down by Law,"[An] odd, funny, strangely mesmerizing three-part comedy.",522
Down by Law,Stylish hipster comedy that delivers the laughs.,522
Cool Hand Luke,Cool Hand Luke has one of cinema’s best character introductions and film openings.,523
Cool Hand Luke,There’s more than a bit of Christ allegory in the imagery but it’s the character of the scruffy prisoners in the impoverished prison... that gives the film its juice.,523
Cool Hand Luke,"In a career filled with iconic anti-heroes -- including what I deem the “4-H Club” from the 1960s (Hud, Harper, Hombre, and The Hustler) -- Lucas Jackson just might be the most popular of all the societal misfits played by Paul Newman.",523
Cool Hand Luke,"Between the thoughtfulness of the narrative and both Newman’s and Kennedy’s performances (for which the latter won an Oscar), one can see why the film is as beloved as it is 56 years later.",523
Cool Hand Luke,Cool Hand Luke harkens back to an earlier era in Warner Bros. when they made gangster and chain gang films but this one is elevated by the likes of Paul Newman and George Kennedy.,523
Cool Hand Luke,"In my mind, the most defining role of Paul Newman's long, illustrious career, and one of the great antihero films told with cruel wit - a black comedy if ever there was one.",523
Cool Hand Luke,"Well written by Pearce and Pierson and acted by a most talented ensemble of performers, Luke succeeds as both a highly humorous and deeply dramatic study of the immolation of human spirit in captivity and as an allegory.",523
Cool Hand Luke,"An archetype of '60s counterculture in cinema, particularly with its nuanced messages of discontent, conspicuous humor, and the unforgettable performance by Paul Newman.",523
Cool Hand Luke,The movie cheats slightly by hinting Newman's death is a triumph - as if all crucifixions were alike. But this is a very small carp at a very fine movie.,523
Cool Hand Luke,"The whole thing depends on Newman's blue eyes, easy grin, and ability to appear charismatic but never cocky.",523
"Great Dictator, The","What is Chaplin’s peculiar gift? It is his power to stand for a sort of concentrated essence of the common man, for the ineradicable belief in decency that exists in the hearts of ordinary people, at any rate in the West.",524
"Great Dictator, The",... confronts the hatred and anti-Semitism of Hitler’s Germany in the days before America’s entry into World War II while lampooning the despots responsible.,524
"Great Dictator, The","It works wonderfully, but The Great Dictator will perhaps be remembered most fondly for Chaplin’s moving closing speech.",524
"Great Dictator, The",For me the film contained one major error: the final speech... This finale is so blatantly out of harmony with what has gone before as to nullify much of the effectiveness of the preceding two hours.,524
"Great Dictator, The","It is not... the genius of Chaplin that permitted him to create The Great Dictator. It was nothing but that moustache. The Tramp waited for the right moment, did what he had to do, then escaped for all eternity with his facial hair intact.",524
"Great Dictator, The","Chaplin beckons the viewer to recognize and fight against tyrants, and every few years, as another despot comes along, The Great Dictator becomes achingly relevant again.",524
"Great Dictator, The",Charlie Chaplin's first talkie became an example of an effective satire. One that was way ahead of its time. [Full review Spanish],524
"Great Dictator, The",Though The Great Dictator provides a good many laughs [it] merits serious consideration for the superior presentation of the message it is trying to put across to that part of the world where democracy is still a precious possession.,524
"Great Dictator, The","More than the expected assemblage of skits, the film attempts to tell a grander, straightforward story, but utilizes too many subplots in the process.",524
"Great Dictator, The","The Great Dictator (1940) is director/actor Charlie Chaplin's first full all-talking (""talkie"" with dialogue) picture (in a film similar to the Marx Brothers' anti-war comedy Duck Soup (1933)) in which he delivered spoken lines...",524
"Big Sleep, The","Chandler’s words burn with pain and self-destruction, but Hawks — who valued strength, independence and action — neutered the inefficiency and hatefulness of Marlowe’s rage.",525
"Big Sleep, The",This is the best plot I’ve ever seen pull this many threads together in such a way where you don’t always have to know what’s going on to know what’s going on. The magic of Bogart.,525
"Big Sleep, The","... an American classic, arguably the greatest film made for a Chandler novel, and the definitive pairing of legendary screen team Bogie and Bacall.",525
"Big Sleep, The","Just when a few solutions are offered up, further conundrums arise, as if fate dictates that Marlowe can never really be finished with a case.",525
"Big Sleep, The","For all the untidiness of its plot, The Big Sleep is, however, an enjoyable melodrama, exciting most of the time and comic when it chooses to be.",525
"Big Sleep, The","There has probably never been so much plot in a film -- but it doesn't seem to matter. It, all looks very exciting, and if you follow half of it you'll get through.",525
"Big Sleep, The","It is a fast-moving drama, knee-deep in corpses, as tough as they come. It is rather'difficult to keep track of who is murdering whom and why, but there is not time to worry about such details with so many bullets flying around.",525
"Big Sleep, The",It is brilliantly directed and photographed. It moves with breathless speed. The acting is admirable. The dialogue (Raymond Chandler and William Faulkner are among those credited) is of an unusually high level of humour and crispness.,525
"Big Sleep, The","...seriously, does anyone care how the chauffeur died?",525
"Big Sleep, The","To watch The Big Sleep is to witness a distinctly American film genre at the heights of its power, nonsensical plot notwithstanding.",525
Ben-Hur,"…Ben-Hur: Full Throttle Drift Racer might have been a better title for this misconcieved, sprawling folly…",526
Ben-Hur,"The decision to film the major set-pieces in extreme close-up was ill-advised, and these murky and incoherent bits are further crippled by obvious CGI as well as rapid-fire editing that recalls those Ginsu blades in action on late-night infomercials.",526
Ben-Hur,Remaking the classic Hollywood epic and 11-time Oscar winner Ben-Hur seems redundant - so 2016's Ben-Hur starts on the back foot.,526
Ben-Hur,"It glosses over familiar scenes and motifs, going through the same old routine without bringing anything new to the table.",526
Ben-Hur,For a movie that wants so badly to be epic-regular swooping helicopter shots of long lines of people walking along some ridge or cliff pepper the film-Ben-Hur lacks any sense of majesty or grandeur.,526
Ben-Hur,"Unfortunately, 'new interpretation' means changing the story dramatically and turning it into a slight rip off of Gladiator and we are not entertained.",526
Ben-Hur,"A spectacle worthy of Cecil B. DeMille but with a story that is more grounded and layered with softer, nuanced, more human emotional performances that go beyond the visual (and visceral) experience.",526
Ben-Hur,Morgan Freeman as Ilderim commands respect and plays his role with an almost regal stature.,526
Ben-Hur,"Ben-Hur suffers from many faith-based genre pitfalls -- on-the-nose dialogue, unsubtle 'cross' imagery and parallelism, saccharine endings.",526
Ben-Hur,It in no way rivals either the 1959 Technicolor version or the great 1925 silent one.,526
Gandhi,[A] stirring tale of one of the most remarkable men to walk this earth... The Gandhi movie is large in so many ways.,527
Gandhi,"You have to read about Attenborough’s deep commitment to the subject, because you couldn’t guess it from what’s on the screen. There is no trace of a point of view; the film feels as if it were directed by a committee.",527
Gandhi,"Richard Attenborough’s Gandhi is about as good a historical biopic as you will find, cemented by one of cinema’s all-time great performances by Ben Kingsley.",527
Gandhi,"Given the inherent obstacles in Gandhi, Richard Attenborough has directed an astonishingly successful epic that pulls audiences along on an emotional tether for nearly 3.5 hours.",527
Gandhi,"While this is a good and worthy film rather than a great one, there is greatness in the performance of the British actor Ben Kingsley.",527
Gandhi,"Like the man himself, Gandhi is not totally successful, but it comes closer to perfection than most.",527
Gandhi,Gandhi is one of the few films in recent years that deserves to be called an epic. It is a magnificent panorama of the life and achievements of Mahatma Gandhi.,527
Gandhi,"At the end of the three-hours-and-10-minutes (plus intermission) running time, it's clear that Attenborough's subject was infinitely more daring than his chronicler. Still, it is almost impossible not to at least like Gandhi.",527
Gandhi,"With its cast of thousands, breathtaking photography and mesmerizing Ravi Shankar score, Gandhi is inspiring, enlightening, and amazingly enough -- entertaining as the life and above all spirit of the greatest 20th century humanitarian unfolds.",527
Gandhi,"There's nothing inherently offensive in making a plushly expensive epic about Gandhi, but aesthetically, the idea seems inappropriate: there's too much money on the screen, and not enough Mahatma.",527

"Killing Fields, The","If you see no more than one film a year, make this the one for 1984.",528
"Killing Fields, The",Ngor's naturalistic and empathic portrayal of his character's desperate fight for survival is the key to this film's visceral power.,528
"Killing Fields, The",[UPDATED 2024 REVIEW] One of the great films of its decade.,528
"Killing Fields, The",Every scene of The Killing Fields (and every participant in its making) is in service of showing how abruptly a seemingly safe and vital individual can have everything essential stripped away.,528
"Killing Fields, The",A gripping romanticized and somewhat fictionalized adaptation of an eyewitness magazine piece by New York Times journalist Sidney Schanberg.,528
My Life as a Dog,Captures puberty and childhood for a boy better than almost any other film,529

My Life as a Dog,"My Life as a Dog succeeds on an intimate, human scale that is entirely appropriate for a story covering about a year in the life of a pretty ordinary boy in a pretty ordinary place.",529
My Life as a Dog,Good coming-of-age movie for older kids.,529
My Life as a Dog,"The frequent collision of comedy and drama is breathtakingly real, and Anton Glanzelius is terrific as Ingemar, a smart 12 year old with a philosophical bent",529

"Man Who Would Be King, The",Huston finally has realized his ambition with the pretty much perfect teaming of Sean Connery and Michael Caine. Christopher Plummer is excellent as Kipling himself and it's a bloody good show.,530

"Man Who Would Be King, The","The result, as one might expect, is lively, totally assured, and certainly one of Huston's more bracing movies, though inevitably the story emerges much expanded, with different emphases.",530
"Man Who Would Be King, The","[John] Huston... has, at 70, created a swan song of rare power, insight and bravado, and those doubters who felt he had out-directed his usefulness will have to take another, closer look.",530
"Man Who Would Be King, The","Kipling's humor, his unique satire, his way of seeing the customs and personality of the English add to the story a series of funny features. [Full Review in Spanish]",530
"Man Who Would Be King, The","It's pure Huston: an impossible quest, an out-of-reach grail and an ironic twist leading to a supremely glorious failure.",530
Shine,"In Always Shine, Sophia Takal solidified herself as a young director to watch",531
Shine,The performative commingling of these two still fresh talents is a blast,531
Shine,"The threats grow more intense, the ""stakes"" constantly raised, the jump scares and music blasts louder. It becomes a more ""intellectual"" version of the cheap horror work it decries. The threats remain superficial.",531
Shine,"With Davis and FitzGerald turning in absolutely mesmerizing performances, Always Shine makes for a simple yet effective little chiller.",531
Shine,A testament to the destructive power of both Hollywood and the inherently narcissistic need of many actors to be recognized and successful.,531
Shine,"There is not a beat to miss or a beat amiss in Sophia Takal's standout second feature, Always Shine.",531
Shine,Be prepared to deal with the wrath of a female friendship gone wrong. Always Shine is laden with so much tension that I felt the strong urge to take a Xanax while watching.,531

Shine,Takal dips her troubled femmes with the type of transcendental touches we've come to expect from cabalistic expressions of madness at the art-house.,531
Shine,"With a haunting finale and two fantastic performances from Mackenzie Davis and Caitlin FitzGerald, this is another winner from Lawrence Michael Levine and Sophia Takal.",531

"Daytrippers, The",Criterion's new release allows this bittersweet tale of becoming to reach a wider audience.,533
"Daytrippers, The","The climactic twist is not only obvious but also registers as a stunt, and the ending is far too abrupt. On the plus side, the performances are uniformly excellent.",533
"Daytrippers, The",A cautionary tale of sorts that also humorously pokes at the kookiness of family.,533
"Daytrippers, The","Thanks to the superb cast and Mottola's deft touch, this modest-looking comedy proves quite memorable.",533
"Daytrippers, The","A spirited cast, including old pros Amma Meara and younger talent Parker Posey and Stanley Tucci, elevates this claustrophobic sitcom (most of whiche is set in a car) into something fluffier and funnier than it actually is.",533

My Own Private Idaho,This is a fabulous disaster. [Full review in Spanish],537
My Own Private Idaho,"Perhaps it is a radical break from the elusive entity we have come to label a ""gay sensibility"" or maybe it is an attempt to redefine it.",537
My Own Private Idaho,"My Own Private Idaho may be an operatic arraignment of the class divide that continues to bring shame on America, Van Sant's film gleams brightest when Phoenix, with his wobbly, puppy-dog charisma appears on screen.",537
My Own Private Idaho,...a great enough idea that it almost doesn't bother me that these stories don't really illuminate one another.,537
My Own Private Idaho,It misrepresents illness in order to be amusing and Shakespeare in order to seem deep.,537
My Own Private Idaho,"""My Own Private Idaho"" is both a love story and a tragedy. It remains the high point in Gus Van Sant's career.",537
My Own Private Idaho,A simultaneously heartbreaking and exhilarating road movie.,537
My Own Private Idaho,"Holding all these elements together is Van Sant's sensibility, such an elusive thing it instinctively squirms away from any attempt to pigeonhole it.",537
My Own Private Idaho,"Although River Phoenix has distinguished himself as an actor ever since his second film, Stand By Me, nothing he has ever done before prepares you for his performance in Private Idaho as the motherless, homeless, loveless piece of human driftwood.",537
Anastasia,We've come to expect and we get spectacular animation but the lack of originality and drama in this anemic cartoon is palpable.,538
Anastasia,"A passable clone, but for all its technical accomplishments, a movie that does not have the magic.",538
Anastasia,"Anastasia is another of Don Bluth’s attempts to wrest control of the genre that remains inferior in nearly every way, except one.",538
Anastasia,The world of “Anastasia” seems well-developed and lived-in. There’s a sense of realism contained in the film’s scenery.,538
Anastasia,It's unable to reach the level of emotional resonance that Disney's string of '90s pictures so masterfully obtained.,538
Anastasia,"As a triumphant return to form after a string of failures, it stands as one of Bluth's finest works.",538
Anastasia,"Overall, Anastasia ends up being a very entertaining animated film.",538
Anastasia,"It is a film that leaves us with an optimistic, albeit somewhat corny, message; love is the most important thing there is, be it familial, romantic or platonic...",538
Anastasia,"Flawed but not fatally, this ambitious epic's strength lies not just with its haunting melodies, pretty pictures, star voices and kid-friendly sidekicks... What gives Anastasia its edge is that most elusive of ingredients, an emotionally gripping script.",538
Anastasia,Anastasia is OK entertainment. But it never reaches a level of emotional magic.,538
Mouse Hunt,The real fun is watching what the special-effects team does with the mouse -- or mice -- who are for the most part trained. The kids giggle while moms and dads roar right along with them.,539
Mouse Hunt,"This feels like a wine o'clock movie (for the kids!) before such a subgenre had even been defined, and as such I can't help but welcome its cruelly sweet heart back into my life.",539
Mouse Hunt,"Mouse Hunt mostly squeaks by thanks to the considerable mugging prowess of its leads players, Lee Evans and Nathan Lane.",539
Mouse Hunt,The comedy shoots for laughs through slapstick and one-liners. The trouble is things are more cheesy than funny.,539

Money Train,"Snipes and Harrelson are still good together, but the screenplay stinks.",540
Money Train,Goes nowhere fast.,540
Money Train,"More viscerally charged than ""Speed"" and hipper than ""Die Hard With a Vengeance,"" the movie is a careening, screeching joyride that showers sparks like fireworks.",540

Mortal Kombat,Mortal Kombat (2021) is the equivalent of making a film called The Olympics and only showed the qualifying rounds before actual Olympians are appointed.,541
Mortal Kombat,The reboot of the franchise that brought us a couple of gory films in the ‘90s fails to land any solid punches this time around.,541
Mortal Kombat,"While far from perfect, Mortal Kombat is still bloody fun, with a solid attempt at adapting the game's insane world.",541
Mortal Kombat,"A lawless victory but it’s also not a fatality. Turn your brain all the way off, grab a giant bucket of popcorn & be prepared for gruesome, gory, & grotesque Fights that are all top notch in everyway! Bring on the sequel",541
Mortal Kombat,"Mortal Kombat is a surprisingly decent adaptation of the popular franchise, which will leave the most hardcore fans quite satisfied. For viewers with no experience or knowledge about the games, it could be a tough watch.",541
Mortal Kombat,"More or less, Mortal Kombat is a two-hour-long gorefest packed with over-the-top actions and brutal fatalities.",541
Mortal Kombat,"Mortal Kombat commits the cardinal sin of being boring, whereas at least the first MK film was so cheesy it was funny, like the source material itself. This attempt at a “realistic” take on the MK lore fails spectacularly.",541
Mortal Kombat,"Unlike previous entries hamstrung by the limitations of a PG-13 rating, this film makes full use of the R rating.",541
Mortal Kombat,“Mortal Kombat” is very much a movie made for the fans. It takes a lot for granted and expects the audience to either already know the backstory or have a certain willingness to just go with it.,541
Mortal Kombat,"Those in search of bloody, bonkers escapism will be well served by Mortal Kombat, which hits the right nostalgic notes and makes the most of the advances in special effects. Its cinematic fast food that will be just the ticket for the right audience.",541
Pocahontas,"A disappointing effort to an audience accustomed to lush characters and brilliant animation on display in The Lion King, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast.",542
Pocahontas,"While a conversation surrounding the morals of Pocahontas deserve attention and space, it is worth knowing that the film itself is also a rather weak outing for Disney.",542
Pocahontas,"This is a real woman's life. And now, the cultural event that is a Disney blockbuster has coopted that life.",542
Pocahontas,It's just frustrating because they had an opportunity to take actual events and make them into a great movie.,542
Pocahontas,"Its comic characters are paltry; its villain is a bloated, harmless Captain Hook; and its story line is negligible as well as palpably silly.",542
Pocahontas,"The film may take you by surprise with its quick ending, running only 76 minutes before the credits roll. I wanted more both times I saw it.",542
Pocahontas,"It's hard to excuse the reconception of the eleven or twelve-year-old Pocahontas...as a statuesque supermodel, especially as kids don't need their stories to be hung on romance to deem them, err, shapely. [Blu-ray]",542
Pocahontas,"""Pocahontas"" isn't an A-movie in the Disney catalog, but it's a solid second-tier film that, despite its romanticizing of the ""noble savage,"" nonetheless features themes that are wholesome and consistent with Disney's messaging.",542
Pocahontas,Fine for kids; just don't expect a history lesson.,542
Pocahontas,The film of the Disney Renaissance likeliest to elicit a shudder of dismay from all but the most maniacal Disney buffs.,542

"Misérables, Les","This is a decidedly gritty and grounded adaptation, with Hooper’s assured direction capturing the horror and humanity of revolutionary France.",543
"Misérables, Les","Hooper brings an appropriate sense of grandness to the musical [...] but overall, the creative choices call more attention to how it was made and distract from the powerful story.",543

Vampire in Brooklyn,"Bassett gives a performance that deserved a better movie, while Allen Payne isn't offered much to work with as the generic ""nice guy,"" though he's a likable one, for sure.",545
Vampire in Brooklyn,"If your idea of a laff riot is a guy's ear falling off, then this movie might be for you. Therapy might be for you, too.",545
Vampire in Brooklyn,Bassett and Murphy might make a fine romantic comedy team if they'll leave the oversized bicuspids at home.,545
Vampire in Brooklyn,What a pity that these funny scenes are separated by wastelands of Serious Plot.,545
Vampire in Brooklyn,"Its one lingering image is that of Eddie Murphy trying, and failing, to rise from the dead.",545
Vampire in Brooklyn,"Striking a good balance between horror and comedy (with the emphasis tilted to the former), this contemporized vampire tale flits along in entertaining fashion before making like a ghoul and falling apart at the end.",545
Vampire in Brooklyn,Never funny enough to pass muster as a comedy and never scary enough (if at all) to make it as a horror movie.,545
Vampire in Brooklyn,"Given the talent involved, it's almost impressive how much of a misfire the film is.",545
Vampire in Brooklyn,Vampire in Brooklyn goes through the motions of a comic-vampire romance with little sense of how to blend its elements.,545
Vampire in Brooklyn,"Craven knows how to set up a couple of good fright shots, but this odd mix of genres yields very little that's really scary and even less that's funny.",545
Broken Arrow,"Broken Arrow is beautifully crafted, mindless entertainment–nothing more, but also nothing less.",546
Broken Arrow,"The movie Broken Arrow remains rentable, while the region's monolithic cliffs still overwhelm the senses.",546
Broken Arrow,"Despite a lot of mayhem taking place on screen, the only memorable component of this ramshackle actioner is Hans Zimmer's score.",546
Broken Arrow,An inane thriller for those with a penchant for films that nuke themselves on purpose.,546
Broken Arrow,"Everything in the Wooeuvre is here and John Travolta acts like a high-school junior getting to play bad for the first time. That's not a knock. For better or worse, ""Broken Arrow"" embodies everything we expected of American action movies in 1996.",546
Broken Arrow,"An intricate, rather beautiful dance of momentum and force.",546
Broken Arrow,"A perfectly entertaining, exciting, and competently made action thriller, [but] it can't help but be somewhat of a letdown.",546
Broken Arrow,"Travolta is camp, but the action is cool in true John Woo style.",546

"Young Poisoner's Handbook, The",O’Conor delivers one of the great hateful/sympathetic performances.,547
"Young Poisoner's Handbook, The",Not nearly as clever as it thinks it is.,547
"Young Poisoner's Handbook, The",The show is a cornucopia of effective cinematic elements. A tour de force and a fascinating story.,547
"Young Poisoner's Handbook, The","Graham Young is at bottom a monster, but, as Hugh O'Conor plays him, he is also peculiarly beguiling. It is easy to sympathize with a bright young man who wants to get ahead in his chosen field.",547
"NeverEnding Story III, The","Nothing touches the original, but this sequel is still good children's viewing.",548
"NeverEnding Story III, The","Okay, I agree since the first one had only half the book a sequel was acceptable, but this wasn't.",548
Rob Roy,"The first point to make about Alan Sharp's script is that it travesties history, bearing only the flimsiest resemblance to the facts of Rob's life... The second point is that it's one of the best screenplays of the last decade.",549
Rob Roy,"Rob Roy has its diversions, but they are unfortunately outweighed by some heavy baggage that contains not enough of substance.",549
Rob Roy,"Where Braveheart was a guts-and-glory battlefield hymn to fortitude, Rob Roy is a more personal, more intelligent, and more wrenching exploration of honor, honesty, and loyalty.",549
Rob Roy,"Rob Roy benefits from a smart script and fine performances by art house regulars Tim Roth and Eric Stoltz, as well as Hollywood stars Liam Neeson and Jessica Lange.",549
Rob Roy,"Neeson makes a less dashing action hero than did Day-Lewis, but he brings enough gravitas to his role to endow his love for his wife Mary (Lange) and his conflict with Cunningham with real emotional punch.",549
Rob Roy,"This historical epic is slightly anachronistic, but the acting of Liam Neeson in the lead and especially Tim Roth as the villain is excellent.",549
Rob Roy,"In their devotion, fiery love scenes, and mutual respect, Neeson and Lange have made marriage more appealing and admirable than any movie has in years.",549
Rob Roy,The best HEAVY sword fight sequence ever filmed.,549
Rob Roy,"Good movie, great sword fights",549
Rob Roy,Contains one of the best cinematic swordfights ever. Incredible flick.,549
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,There are times we like this one more than the original.,550
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are a fantastic double act and only add to the fun action scenes. Easily the second best Die Hard film and one of the best action films full stop.,550
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,"Whereas Die Hard 2 downgraded Bruce Willis’ McClane to your average invincible superhero, all too common in action flicks, this 1995 release returns humanity to the character.",550
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,"If you are an action fan you will love Die Hard With A Vengeance. All you need is a strong stomach and a penchant for masochism. If you can endure the pain threshhold, you won't mind the glaring plot inconsistencies, woeful stereotyping and banal story.",550
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,Doesn't play as well as it does as a lone wolf vehicle.,550
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,"...this second sequel certainly has a lot to offer, as long as coherence isn't your bag...",550
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,Samuel L. Jackson ensures that Bruce Willis' third stint as the ragged detective John McClane is a triumphant one.,550
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,"Fast-paced, regularly thrilling, and with a greater serving of wisecracks.",550
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,Irons is fabulous...,550
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,"Maybe not movie bliss, as the original, unexpected ""Die Hard"" was, but semi-bliss, for sure. By all means go (as if I needed to tell you).",550
Lord of Illusions,These days the horror film is practically a bankrupt genre...,551
Lord of Illusions,From the mind of Clive Barker comes....one weird-ass horror noir.,551
Lord of Illusions,"The problem with the story is that it's overlong, full of bland details, and engrossed with bloodshed over sensible occult configurations.",551
Lord of Illusions,"Awesomely '90s Day-Glo noir, Lord of Illusions has everything you want.",551
Lord of Illusions,Gruesome but somewhat intelligent supernatural thriller.,551
Lord of Illusions,Clive Barker is the Douglas Sirk of splatter.,551
Lord of Illusions,"Sadly, with Lord of Illusions, Clive Barker stumbles into the same pitfalls he did when he made Nightbreed just five years earlier. It's dull, unengaging, and features a plot that is stretched out far past its breaking point.",551
Lord of Illusions,"It's a sad day for both fright fans and the man Stephen King once prophesied was ""the future of horror"".",551
Lord of Illusions,A terrific little horror film expertly renderd from Barker's own short story.,551
Lord of Illusions,"Better than people give it credit for, especially if the viewer fully appreciates the gay subtext.",551
Species,20000 Species of Bees [...] was a delicate reminder of those who do accept us and open the door. Even if just a crack. Those people are there and they change lives.,552
Species,"[A] willingness to look at delicate matters in totality, combined with a spectacular cast of performers all given highly detailed characters to work with, makes 20,000 Species of Bees an exceptional family drama.",552
Species,"It conveys the calm and warmth of summer holidays, and uses said context to develop a complex narrative, which manages to put us in the shoes of a girl who tries to communicate to her family that she does not feel like what she is. Full review in Spanish.",552
Species,"By showing this as a process of growth, albeit one fraught with emotional obstacles, Urresolo Sologuren adds something new to the discourse, while young Otero’s entrancing debut holds the attention even without major dramatic quakes.",552
Species,Warmly humanist and deeply empathetic first feature… announcing the arrival of a bold new filmmaking voice.,552
Species,"20,000 Species of Bees is a slow burn where most scenes are understated and intimate but culminate into a work that stands strong in the end.",552
Species,A warmly empathetic view of both a trans child and her surrounding family.,552
Species,"Writer-director Estíbaliz Urresola Solaguren drops us into a family’s life to let us live with them and gradually figure out, as they do, what’s going on. She strings together clues but lets the story reveal itself in its own time.",552
Species,The film will speak to anyone who feels they are playing an artificial role in their life or in an internal war of deciding what is true to them versus what may be more comfortable for the rest of the world.,552
Species,"The film never veers into coming-out clichés, painting an artful portrait of a family learning to lean on each other.",552

Waterworld,This one is a hydro-punk war of all against all...,554
Waterworld,"This should be called “What in the World.""",554
Waterworld,"Waterworld has the epic scale, the grandeur, the towering oceanic shots, the boisterous (if sometimes misjudged) score and the vast, expensive sets. It just has no soul.",554
Waterworld,There are hints that the editing ran amok in an all-out effort to reduce the running time to the present two hours.,554
Waterworld,...kicks off with an exciting action sequence set aboard a man-made atoll that's certainly a breathtaking marvel of production design...,554
Waterworld,My Kevin Costner gettin' all Mad Max on a turbo jet-ski beats your Eddie Murphy goin' through the motions.,554
Waterworld,"A very dignified production with some tremendously stimulating ideas that, yes, were not entirely well exposed in the movie that came to theaters two decades ago. [Full Review in Spanish]",554
Waterworld,"Waterworld may not be a masterpiece, but it is certainly a shining example of large scale entertainment as only Hollywood can deliver.",554
Waterworld,"That Costner's antihero should be so fundamentally dislikable is entirely acceptable - after all, the Mariner's arc makes him an eternal outsider... - but that he should also be deadly dull is less so",554
White Man's Burden,"While flipping this racial dynamic is meant to demonstrate the ills of racism, White Man's Burden still centers whiteness.",555
White Man's Burden,A wierd and ungainly mixture of obvious racial issues and pseudo-action material.,555
White Man's Burden,Doesn't go too far beyond the basic set-up.,555
White Man's Burden,"The racial message is crystal clear and the concept of turning the tables on oppression is rather interesting. Unfortunately, the movie is never focused or convincingly solid to realize the cynicism in its meandering material. At best, ""Burden"" is merely",555
White Man's Burden,"Were it not for John Travolta's big-hearted portrayal of an unemployed white factory worker driven to commit a desperate act, the movie would be an emotionally frozen exercise in cautious high-mindedness.",555
White Man's Burden,"Manages to approach significant social issues, but falters in its melodrama.",555
White Man's Burden,Just when Travolta got his groove back..,555
White Man's Burden,A look at color relations that's likely to be more compelling for nonurban audiences than the latest take on drug dealing and gang banging in the 'hood.,555
White Man's Burden,"Una sociedad en la que existe una raza dominante y una raza oprimida, casi como ahora, con la ligera diferencia de que ahora el racismo es al revs.",555
White Man's Burden,White Man's Burden spirals into tragedy but never into stirring drama. It stays stuck at the level of noble experiment.,555
Wild Bill,"Jeff Bridges exquisitely captures this roaming, morose existence, this juxtaposition between the stature of an icon and the elegiac crawl towards death that we follow him on.",556
Wild Bill,"Wild Bill, starring Jeff Bridges, is Walter Hill’s best film in years. It’s a movie about the self-destructive power of myth. By the end, Hill makes that self-destruction seem like the archetypal American story.",556
Wild Bill,"Jeff Bridges delivers an intense performance, but an animated Ellen Barkin seems to have wandered over from the set of a sitcom.",556
Wild Bill,"Considering Walter Hill's formidable filmography, Wild Bill hasn't aged as well as some of the auteur's progressively inclined titles, but is still worth a look for the expected technical and narrative proficiencies.",556
Wild Bill,"Not just an elegy for the myth of the Old West, it's an elegy for a time and a place that never really existed in the first place.",556
Wild Bill,The main problem in Wild Bill is that it seeks-and fails-to balance New Hollywood introspection with B-movie theatrics and action.,556
Wild Bill,"Interesting take on Wild Bill Hickock, again mixing more fable with his real life.",556
Wild Bill,A rare Walter Hill movie that just didn't work for me.,556
Wild Bill,"A Hot, Adrenaline-Pumping Western...Barkin is blistering!",556
Wild Bill,"A tedious, confusing, and dismal account of the historical figure.",556
Farinelli: il castrato,"In an age in which the castrato voice no longer exists, the moviemakers recreated an intriguing facsimile.",557
Farinelli: il castrato,"Farinelli is lush and theatrical in the way you'd expect a movie about an opera singer to be but, somehow, it's also dry and dull.",557
Farinelli: il castrato,"While visually vibrant and generally well-acted, Farinelli is strangely not very compelling.",557

Heavenly Creatures,Heavenly Creatures is a haunting film that stays with you. It’s dark and disturbing and strangely beautiful. Like a lonely walk through a solitary park on a brisk Christchurch afternoon in June.,558

Heavenly Creatures,A movie as swooningly self- intoxicated as its schoolgirl protagonists.,558
Heavenly Creatures,A film as fascinating as the obsessive friendship it depicts.,558

"Kid in King Arthur's Court, A","Rarely do the well-financed wizards at Walt Disney Pictures cook up a movie this badly written, acted, and directed.",560
"Kid in King Arthur's Court, A",Lame and surprisingly awkward from start to finish.,560
"Kid in King Arthur's Court, A",The ragtag adaptation by Michael Part and Robert Levy is familiar fodder run through a blender too high and too fast.,560
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,...a briskly-paced yet mostly uninvolving adaptation...,561
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,"The movie may be uneven, but Arrow's release is gorgeous.",561
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,It’s too bad that the filmmakers couldn’t include women in their reverence with the sort of understanding that Mary Shelley showed toward men.,561
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,"Flamboyant, melodramatic, full of sound and fury and fire and lightning and blood and amniotic fluid, Kenneth Branagh’s film is a feverishly ambitious work",561
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,Kenneth Branagh's caffeinated take on the tale survives crucial miscasting in a significant role.,561

"Quick and the Dead, The",...a pared-down premise that's employed to predominantly entertaining (and sporadically spellbinding) effect by Raimi...,562
"Quick and the Dead, The",Frequent gun violence in quirky '90s Western.,562
"Quick and the Dead, The",The plot of this low-camp revenge thriller is little more than an excuse to line up one badass cowboy (or girl) opposite another and let the eyeball-to-eyeball fireworks fly.,562
"Quick and the Dead, The","Sam Raimi does a lot of interesting things in The Quick and the Dead and Sharon Stone plays a convincing female gunfighter, but the one-horse plot with no subplots to generate additional interest becomes a drag.",562
"Quick and the Dead, The","Raimi's movie borrows heavily from classic spaghetti westerns, but Raimi has a style of his own, and plenty of it.",562
"Quick and the Dead, The","A deadpan black comedy, Sam Raimi's fast-paced movie looks and sounds like a Leone oater but more so.",562

"Quick and the Dead, The",See it for yourself - surprising,562
Stephen King's The Langoliers,"As the scriptwriter for ""The Langoliers,"" [Tom] Holland has strung together some of the clunkiest dialogue you're ever likely to hear. As the director he has encouraged his mediocre cast to overact shamelessly.",563
Stephen King's The Langoliers,"Is it the post-apocalypse? Is it another dimension? Or is it a half-decent episode of The Twilight Zone stretched into a miniseries? Whatever the case, expect cries of ""For God's sake get on with it!"" to reverberate around your living room.",563
Stephen King's The Langoliers,"The two-parter takes a while to gather momentum, but the second installment is a tense, eerie barn-burner.",563
Stephen King's The Langoliers,It would take a great dramatic performance by [Bronson] Pinchot for the film to have any chance of working. He doesn't deliver.,563
Stephen King's The Langoliers,"You spend hours in the company of cardboard characters, under the doughy direction of Tom Holland, waiting for something scary to happen, and at long last your payoff is a couple of minutes of cheesy special effects. Anyone's idea of a good time?",563
Stephen King's The Langoliers,"The cast, on the whole, creates believable characters in an unbelievable situation.",563
Stephen King's The Langoliers,"It offers decent special effects, and the suspense of King's story contains enough takeoffs and landings to make Flight 29 an unpredictable, and moderately enjoyable, ride.",563
Stephen King's The Langoliers,"The series isn't scary; the special effects are routine until the final hour, when flying furry villains with shears for teeth chew up everything in sight, and there isn't any mesmerizing performance to propel it.",563
Stephen King's The Langoliers,"""The Langoliers"" may not give you shrieking nightmares, but it does seem good for at least a dose of squirmy insomnia.",563
Stephen King's The Langoliers,"The inflated story goes fairly predictable in a hurry, and the underlining is heavyhanded.",563
Tales from the Hood,"[Director Rusty Cundieff] manages to amuse more often than horrify. This tends to make his ""Tales"" more ready for prime time than the big screen, but more entertaining than a silly haunted house ride at a summer carnival.",564
Tales from the Hood,It ingeniously employs the multi-saga format popularized by the likes of Dead of Night and Tales from the Crypt as a springboard for an examination of real problems facing African-American communities.,564
Tales from the Hood,"In each macabre tale, Cundieff reconsiders the past through a new method of evaluation and representation, using grim horror stories to capture a glimpse of modern and historical reality.",564
Tales from the Hood,"Tales from the Hood isn't just unique in its subject matter, but also in that it's an auteur-led horror anthology with something to say.",564
Tales from the Hood,"If Get Out is about the way racism now hides behind America's grinning, faux-liberal facade, Tales is about how poverty and ignorance are causing young black men and women to rage war against themselves.",564

Village of the Damned,"Whereas the 1960 version was eerie and intriguing, this take is awkward and ugly.",565
Village of the Damned,"There's nothing worse than an un-scary scary movie. ""Damned"" is too long on drama, too short on horror and, what is most annoying, too insulting to our intelligence.",565
Village of the Damned,"So bad, so unimaginative, so poorly directed, you end up gawking at the screen entranced.",565
Village of the Damned,"Although it's not in the same league as Carpenter's other notable remake (his 1982 version of The Thing remains unparalleled), it's well worth reassessment.",565
Village of the Damned,"The film feels somewhat dead. It's not tapping into a cultural vein, or expressing some sort of parental nightmare, it's just echoing those prior ones in a totally unsatisfying way.",565
Village of the Damned,John Carpenter's version of the original story is compelling and absolutely entertaining.,565
Village of the Damned,"It's the kind of film that appears to have been made by filmmakers who don't understand a thing about storytelling, pacing, tone, or atmosphere, which is only made all the more shocking by the fact that it was directed by the legendary John Carpenter.",565
Village of the Damned,"The real shock came when I noticed that a woman filing out of the premiere screening beside me had actually marked her rating card with an ""excellent"" grade.",565
Village of the Damned,John Carpenter's return to horror fizzles.,565
Village of the Damned,"Not bad, but Superman deserved a better sendoff before his paralysis.",565
Clear and Present Danger,The story is satisfyingly complex and the characters have been developed beyond the two-dimensional ciphers that usually serve in this kind of movie.,566

Clear and Present Danger,Plot suffocates the film. Simply too much happens.,566
Clear and Present Danger,"The premise is a fairly standard backstabbing and covert operations blend, but the details are substantial.",566
Clear and Present Danger,"In both novel and film, Ryan is the moral centre, but the film jettisons the book's range of supporting characters whose differing values help define his position.",566

Wes Craven's New Nightmare,"Quintessential Wes Craven: smart, creative, meta and featuring a number of dazzling horror set pieces. Langenkamp shines, particularly in the hospital scenes.",567
Wes Craven's New Nightmare,Wes Craven brings the most unique and artistic installment for his return. The pre-Scream meta storytelling is fresh and fun for fans of the franchise and Freddy is actually scary again. I do find myself missing the imaginative carnage along the way.,567
Wes Craven's New Nightmare,This story about stories was so much less interesting than a story about nightmares in suburbia.,567

Speed,"Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, a runaway bus, and a killer high concept combined to create one of the best action movies of the ‘90s. (30th anniversary)",568
Speed,"A perfect marriage of concept, cast and execution. The proof of its success is that even though it may feel like it's been left behind by time, action flicks today owe an undisputed debt to what the movie achieved.",568
Speed,A well-paced thrill ride of a Die Hard-type action genre.,568
Speed,"...a landmark action picture that remains, all these years later, one of the best entries within a notoriously uneven genre.",568
Speed,Speed picks up the year's wildest and silliest suspense premise and runs with it. Runs? This hyperkinetic thriller puts pedal to the metal and blows the competition off the road.,568
Speed,Delivers on everything a slick summer popcorn blockbuster should. [Full review in Spanish],568
Speed,"[Speed sets] the standard, at least this summer, for what a fast-paced, don't-think-too-much-about-plot actioner ought to be.",568
Speed,"A technical exercise so relentless, yet also so light of foot and heart, that it comes close to the summer-movie version of art.",568
Speed,Speed is both a reminder of the pleasures of well-done mindlessness and graceful evidence that Hollywood's newest generation of talent can play the box office game if and when it wants to.,568
Speed,"The action in Speed is unrelenting for the most part, moving from one explosion to another and keeping the viewers entertained throughout the almost two-hour running time.",568
Wyatt Earp,A laborious epic Western in an otherwise handsomely mounted production.,570
Wyatt Earp,Director Lawrence Kasdan's three-hour plus journey to the notorious shoot-out at the OK Corral is a monumental western that works both as a serious history lesson and as a quietly understated drama.,570
Wyatt Earp,"In each of his fine, flavorful scenes, Quaid handily supplies the energy and humor sorely lacking from the rest of this tedious, windy film.",570
Wyatt Earp,The movie’s potential as a complex epic Western leaks out somewhere in the second hour.,570
Wyatt Earp,"Wyatt Earp tries to confront us with something weightier than the pleasures of old-fashioned heroism. Unfortunately, it ends up offering something sketchier: a psychodramatic hero without a center.",570
Wyatt Earp,"Wyatt Earp presents unvarnished historical realism as a kind of ultimate Truth, and it might actually work if Kasdan didn't keep piling on the Western-movie clichés.",570
Wyatt Earp,"Quaid, who lost 43 pounds for the role, looks like the original cowboy junkie, a hollow-cheeked spectre. And every moment he is onscreen, he injects such delightful venom into his scenes that the flatness of the film around him becomes all too obvious.",570
Wyatt Earp,"Gorgeously shot and meticulously designed, Wyatt Earp is big, solemn -- and barely alive.",570
Wyatt Earp,"Wyatt Earp has few ""things"" happening; it's merely a series of events. And in the end, the hero's descent into mindless killing makes him both unsympathetic and unreadable.",570
Wyatt Earp,"Unfortunately, the film's epic framework and glacial star prevent even this lightly revisionist treatment from having much impact.",570
Another Stakeout,A decent sequel...,571
Another Stakeout,"Another Stakeout boasts a fine cast, but the writing is so uneven and the plot so poorly developed that the film's few amusing moments get lost.",571
Another Stakeout,"Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez still make as copacetic a team as they did six years ago...[but] Another Stakeout feels like warmed-over stuff, Badham's belated attempt to create his own ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise.",571

Blown Away,...engrossing subject matter that’s employed to mostly first-class effect by Hopkins...,572
Blown Away,"Here's one of those American action fillums that just plain works, despite lacking a story, or a cast that acts the house down.",572
Blown Away,The stunts and bomb-diffusing excitement (including an earth-shattering fulmination toward the finale) generally outweigh the contrivances and editing problems.,572

Body Snatchers,"[The] camera.. conjures dark beauty and adds hallucinatory planes of color and shadow in a movie shot almost entirely on practical San Francisco locations. [Actors] are all on Kaufman’s wavelength: sustaining mood [in] a feat of shared, uncommon bravura.",573
Body Snatchers,"Kaufman’s invasion tracks the encroachment of consumerist conformity upon the liberated individualism of 60s Frisco – and would acquire new, unintended resonance when its theatrical release was immediately preceded by the collective madness of Jonestown.",573
Body Snatchers,"Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a modernized version of the small masterpiece. The 1978 film is enlarged, and a bit inflated... but the theme is so chilling that is remains alive, in a work of allegorical scares. [Full review in Spanish]",573
Body Snatchers,Philip Kaufman’s remake of the 1956 classic updates it from the homespun innocence small town fifties America to the busy urban modernity of San Francisco of the seventies and gives the metaphor a new context.,573
Body Snatchers,Invasion of the Body Snatchers is more sheer fun than any movie I’ve seen since Carrie and Jaws and maybe parts of The Spy Who Loved Me.,573
Body Snatchers,"The original Invasion of the Body Snatchers from 1956 is great, but Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake is far superior.",573
Body Snatchers,Communism gives way to psychiatry as our boogeymen now come from within in Philip Kaufman’s superior version of the classic story.,573
Body Snatchers,"Surprisingly... the film is a triumph. For once, a remake has not trespassed the original, but re-explored, updated and defined it for a new audience.",573
Body Snatchers,One of the greatest science fiction horror films of all time.,573
Body Snatchers,Philip Kaufman transforms Invasion of the Body Snatchers from an effective remake of a paranoid '50s sci-fi tale into an intertextual narrative and film-watching experience.,573
Boxing Helena,"I am probably prevented by some unwritten law from divulging the end of Boxing Helena. I can only say that, instead of adding an extra twist to this bizarre tale, it deprives it of what little point it had.",574
Boxing Helena,Both the beauty and her beastly pursuer remain too blankly generic for the implications of the movie's main metaphor to come through vividly.,574
Boxing Helena,"Instead of the grotesque sexual humiliation of Kim Basinger we were all hoping for, we get schoolgirl surrealism.",574
Boxing Helena,"'Boxing Helena'' is a bad film - with terrible acting, cliched dialogue, a silly script, pedestrian camera work and inferior direction.",574
Boxing Helena,"Take one peak into the shoddy, tasteless Boxing Helena, and you'll realize why Madonna and Kim Basinger bailed out of the title role.",574
Boxing Helena,[An] ambitious but unsuccessful curiosity.,574
Boxing Helena,"It's probably just as well that last-minute dropouts Kim Basinger or Madonna didn't take the title role, as the presence of a star lurking powerlessly on the little platform no doubt would have been distracting and more laughable than it [is] now.",574
Boxing Helena,"It is curious that Lynch, having taken so many visual cues from her father, has an inadequate grasp of this compassion. The paralyzing obsession that permeates many of her father's works, on the other hand, she comprehends well.",574
Boxing Helena,Grotesquely misconceived.,574
Boxing Helena,"Prior to its world premiere at Sundance, Boxing Helena, the debut of David Lynch's daughter Jennifer, was the hottest film in the festival; two hours later, the movie was dead.",574
City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold,"Fans of the original may enjoy a return to the ranch and the buddy movie antics that follow, but this sequel never quite harnesses the charm of the first film.",575
City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold,"Crystal and director Paul Weiland shoot themselves in the foot by borrowing shamelessly from almost every other western ever conceived -- including the first ""Slickers.""",575
City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold,"Tries too hard to replicate the ""City Slickers"" experience without fully appreciating what made the original film so special.",575
City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold,"Here, the motivation isn't excitement or bolstering self-esteem as much as it is just greed and dwelling on regrets.",575

Cliffhanger,"Big alpine action with megastar Sylvester Stallone taking on dual thieving villains in a treacherous mountain setting makes this a defining 90s movie thriller, full of quotable one-liners and memorable set pieces and kills.",576
Cliffhanger,What I would give for more films with Cliffhanger’s sense of scale and spectacle.,576
Cliffhanger,The main thing that lets Cliffhanger down is a plot as thin as the high-altitude air that surrounds it.,576
Cliffhanger,An admittedly frivolous yet highly entertaining action-heavy survivalist thriller.,576
Cliffhanger,...Cliffhanger kicks off with an enthralling sequence detailing a perilous rescue attempt within the aforementioned Rocky Mountains.,576
Cliffhanger,"If you're a Stallone fan and a 4K enthusiast, this is a must-see for the sheer wonderment of the visuals. If you're one of those who can take or leave Sly and is nonplussed on 4K, there's really not much on offer for you here.",576
Cliffhanger,"Cliffhanger does its damnedest to see that the audience gets its money's worth of thrills. But for all the state-of-the-art stunt work, the movie has little personality; it's ice cream without flavor.",576
Cliffhanger,"Its special effects and scenery tower over its dialogue, its plotting and its character development, which are near rock bottom.",576
Cliffhanger,it has truly awe-inspiring stunts and special effects and many of its suspense sequences will leave you with your heart in your mouth.,576
Cliffhanger,"There's a visceral charge to the high-altitude chase scenes, but the thriller ultimately falls flat, even on its own limited terms.",576
Coneheads,"Aykroyd's comedy is extreme and bizarre, sometimes even gross, but often endearing and rich in amusing parody of contemporary American society.",577

Coneheads,"Whether on Earth or in space, the jokes are either flat or hopelessly crude.",577
Coneheads,"A sweet, funny anarchic pastiche that should find broad based popularity.",577

Coneheads,Feh!,577
Coneheads,What's so funny?,577
Demolition Man,"Demolition Man has been charming & entertaining fans for over 30 years with its exciting action, silly sense of humor, and over-the-top performances, all of which make it easy to see why the film has endured for so long.",578
Demolition Man,"Still, dialogue-wise, the screenplay of Demolition Man is quite a thing to behold. The movie is full of extremely quotable one-liners and absurd exchanges that are made all the funnier by its performances...",578
Demolition Man,An essential action comedy with unforgettable performances from Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes. [Full Review in Spanish],578
Demolition Man,"It starts with explosions, gunfire, characters smashing through windows, careening down staircases, and lunging through five foot flames - all before the opening credits roll.",578
Demolition Man,"Some clever set-piece chases and skirmishes, and a sly sense of humour round out a very solid effort.",578
Demolition Man,"This movie is completely bonkers, it makes no sense.",578
Demolition Man,"More than two hours, it could've easily been under 90 minutes...Sandra Bullock is completely wasted in this film.",578

Fatal Instinct,"There aren’t enough great moments to make this production altogether entertaining – despite a few solid, littler chuckles and some clever, noirish, metaphoric blunders.",579
Fatal Instinct,"Taken on its own, Fatal Instinct is rarely hilarious and only fleetingly suspenseful. About all it offers is a series of trivia games, as hardcore movie buffs guess the sources and whisper eagerly to one another.",579
Fatal Instinct,A continuously ineffective parody picture...,579
Fatal Instinct,"Naturally the film pokes fun at the conventions of the film medium as well, but the routines are endlessly protracted.",579
Fatal Instinct,The filmmakers have provided critics ample artillery by prominently featuring a skunk in this thuddingly flat spoof of erotic thrillers.,579

Kalifornia,It is an exciting...action film based on an interesting script with good performances (especially from Pitt and Lewis).,581
Kalifornia,Sena has a nifty knack for playing out major twists in a minor key.,581
Kalifornia,"Pitt and Lewis have made an unfortunate choice for their first big-screen collaboration. In fact, the flashes of acting brilliance that they show in this messy, often-pretentious production are its only real points of interest.",581
Kalifornia,"It is pulpy trash masquerading as an art film, ultimately failing to be either.",581
Kalifornia,"An uneven mess of a vehicle for its stars, one that did no favors for anyone starring, including Pitt.",581
Kalifornia,What makes Kalifornia intriguing is the manner in which these characters all relate to one another. Where the film suffers is in its obliviousness toward its own obviousness.,581
Kalifornia,"Parts of it seem intent on being a thriller, while others are played as though the story is a dark comedy. Consequently, you aren't always sure whether to laugh or tense up.",581
Kalifornia,"If you hop aboard this sick, unjoyful ride, you'd better bail out early. Unsafe at any speed, this dramatic vehicle goes up in flames.",581
Kalifornia,The movie is a road trip that takes a bad turn to hell. Check it out.,581

Romeo Is Bleeding,"Lena Olin delivers a bravura performance that overwhelms everything else in the picture, much like a tsunami laying waste to a seaside shack.",583
Romeo Is Bleeding,"...Medak's film is something more than a cop thriller or action movie, but a meditation on not knowing that fate has caught up with you until it's too late...",583
Romeo Is Bleeding,The film comes across as being an ironic pastiche rather than legitimate neo-noir.,583
Romeo Is Bleeding,It's exactly the type of dark hearted nightmare all but extinct in today's landscape of commercialized narratives.,583
Romeo Is Bleeding,The result is a total delectable mess that likely has a drinking game embedded in it somewhere.,583
Romeo Is Bleeding,It's noir lite.,583
Romeo Is Bleeding,"It's a senseless, tasteless and demented postmodern noir that has about as much class as a gimpy $10 Times Square hooker.",583
Romeo Is Bleeding,This is a battle-of-the-sexes movie played out at such a pitch of pervsity and amorality that it ultimately becomes rather laughable.,583
Romeo Is Bleeding,[It's] never content with one cliche when it can shovel on ten.,583
Romeo Is Bleeding,"The cast tries to make up for the script's hollowness by hurling themselves headlong into the sort of bloody, sweating, spittle-spewing performances that can sometimes turn thin material into personal triumphs, but to little avail.",583
"Secret Garden, The","Roger Deakins’ photography captures the beauty and the awe of the house and the garden, making for a truly immersive viewing experience.",584
"Secret Garden, The",Maybe it’s not worth complaining that there aren’t more films like The Secret Garden when the way it quietly excels is partially dependent on how modest its pleasures are in comparison to its louder peers.,584

Son in Law,Alternately stupid and offensive.,585
Son in Law,"It's all good, stupid fun.",585
Son in Law,"This story was never going to be great moviemaking, but it might have been more palatable if Shore had been able to make Crawl even marginally likable.",585
Terminal Velocity,"Although the realism is at a staggering low, the screenplay is surprisingly clever, using quite a few jokes and suspenseful situations for impressive comedic effect.",586
Terminal Velocity,...a perfectly watchable (if entirely forgettable) little thriller...,586
Terminal Velocity,"As a wise-cracking sky-diving instructor, Charlie Sheen wears his usual look of someone who has just been asked a really difficult question (like: how come your career has lasted this long?).",586
Terminal Velocity,"A brisk, sleek wrong-man story that's easily the better of 1994's dueling skydiver movies and, had a darker Charlie Sheen from another universe not swapped places with our own, might have made the actor Kurt Russell's action-movie heir apparent.",586
Terminal Velocity,Some of the comic writing undercuts the preposterous story.,586
Terminal Velocity,An absolute piece of terminal trash.,586
Terminal Velocity,"Not exciting enough to be a Die Hard, not funny enough to be a Hot Shots! film either.",586
Terminal Velocity,Fun action movie if you forgive the total silliness.,586
Terminal Velocity,"Although the realism is at a staggering low, the screenplay is surprisingly clever, using quite a few jokes and suspenseful situations for impressive comedic effect.",586

"Hour of the Pig, The","Far from being a stuffy period piece, the movie is fun and intellectually engaging.",587
"Hour of the Pig, The",Among the irreverence is the fact that modern slang is often sprinkled amid the medieval talk...,587
"Hour of the Pig, The","A unique subject, though it's presented a little unevenly. Firth is a real charmer.",587
"Hour of the Pig, The",A quirky British film that seems to aim halfway between Monty Python and Sommersby.,587
Beauty and the Beast,"Imitation, emulation, and homage are all part of that process, but so is reappraisal and reinterpretation. Those later two actions are what drive this new fantasy film to soaring and successful heights.",588
Beauty and the Beast,This film is a careless exercise in capital gain; it mines a true cinema classic for commercial value and leaves nothing artistic in its wake.,588
Beauty and the Beast,Thoroughly enchanting and the story is queerer than ever...,588
Beauty and the Beast,"Rather than going back to the original fairy tale by Mme. Leprince de Beaumont and reenvisioning it, the film reformats the studios cherished animated original with actors and computer-animated special FX. It's less a remake than a replication.",588
Beauty and the Beast,"You can add Beauty and the Beast to the list of well made Disney live-action remakes. While not better than the 1991 original, it is a nice representation of one of the greatest animated films ever made and more evidence that Disney can do no wrong.",588
Beauty and the Beast,Redeeming love shines once again in Disney's live-action remake...,588
Beauty and the Beast,"In a year in which many of the biggest hits have been little more than sops to fanboys more interested in bloodletting than storytelling, here's a film for everyone ... It manages to return a splash of magic to the movies, even if only momentarily.",588
Beauty and the Beast,Tries to cash in on the magic without capturing what was behind that fairy dust in the first place.,588
Beauty and the Beast,"Beauty And The Beast is hardly a masterpiece, but it's not faint praise to say it does its job nicely.",588
Beauty and the Beast,"Beauty and the Beast is a fancy affair, but delivers too little for me to fall in love with.",588
"Wild Bunch, The","While I don’t exactly have the stomach for the violence, the sexism or the racism/xenophobia of The Wild Bunch, I do admire it for its artistic and technical aspects. There’s something oddly fascinating about the film...",589
"Wild Bunch, The",To say that The Wild Bunch is a violent masterpiece would not be an understatement.,589
"Wild Bunch, The","The pictorial style of the film — classical, elegiac — bumps up against the technique that fractures and prolongs death.",589
"Wild Bunch, The","Apart from Peckinpah's simple technical control and the cut of his script, which is a knife that never slips off the bone, there is an angry quality to his mind.",589
"Wild Bunch, The","Demystifying the traditional Western through raw, unglamorous violence, The Wild Bunch exploded onto the screen in 1969 and altered the face of the genre, and filmmaking, forever.",589
"Wild Bunch, The","This controversial epic was as highly praised as it was condemned upon its release, boomingly announcing the arrival of daring new director.",589
"Wild Bunch, The",It is one of the greatest of all westerns.,589
"Wild Bunch, The","It has canonized, for our enjoyment and monstrous edification, the freak-out.",589
"Wild Bunch, The",The result is one of the strongest emotional kickbacks of any film. The Wild Bunch does for the emotions what Shane did for the intellect.,589
"Wild Bunch, The",The film drives to its foregone conclusion with the sureness of an arrow.,589
Hellraiser: Bloodline,...a progressively underwhelming endeavor...,590
Hellraiser: Bloodline,"Miss it if you can. If not, it's your own fault.",590
Hellraiser: Bloodline,An incredibly ambitious sequel that tries to do everything but accomplishes nothing.,590
Hellraiser: Bloodline,"The special makeup effects have marginally improved since the previous chapters, with more bloodthirstiness and outrageous gore occupying the screentime.",590
Hellraiser: Bloodline,"[It's] the last [film of the franchise] to develop [its] story around the original premise rather than simply tacking Hellraiser elements onto a pre-existing script. As such it's one which, for all its problems, fans will want to seek out.",590
Hellraiser: Bloodline,There are just enough good ideas sitting around in their loneliness that you can imagine a version of this story that is actually worthwhile.,590
Hellraiser: Bloodline,It's a surefire sign you're in for a thrill ride when you see director Alan Smithee at it again...,590
Hellraiser: Bloodline,"Except for the most undiscriminating gorehound, pic is a pointless mess.",590
Hellraiser: Bloodline,"Actually the most intriguing entry of the series, with all the backstory.",590
Hellraiser: Bloodline,'Alan Smithee' is a wuss. This film isn't half bad.,590
Primal Fear,The tense crime procedural thriller has a twist in its last act that fails to do it justice.,591
Primal Fear,"A presumably innocent man and a justice-seeking defense lawyer delve into a complex tangle of crime and murder in Primal Fear, a sometimes grating, sometimes invigorating courtroom drama mixed with investigative police procedural.",591
Primal Fear,A tense psychological thriller rich with shadowy menace and a sense of confidence that allows the impressive cast to shine.,591
Primal Fear,It's part trial procedural but mostly the suspenseful unraveling of testimony and the realization of lies.,591
Primal Fear,The part of the script that's dialogue instead of plot is quite snappy. So I believed in this sordid story... for a while.,591
Primal Fear,...a solid drama that's elevated on an all-too-consistent basis by Norton's impressively hypnotic work.,591
Primal Fear,"Edward Norton became an instant star after making a splashy, Oscar-nominated performance in this well-executed horror thriller.",591
Primal Fear,"An unfolding mystery in which truth is elusive, and twists are the order of the day...gives Norton a career-making opportunity to strut his stuff. [Blu-ray]",591
Primal Fear,its heroes only heroes because they believe in order and not because they're capable of order's championing or restoration.,591
Primal Fear,"Helped greatly by excellent performances from both of the film's leads, as well as the rounded supporting cast.",591
True Crime,It's all wrong; Eastwood is even miscast.,592
True Crime,A beat-the-clock thriller with an edge of moral gravity.,592
True Crime,Forget the mystery thriller plot... succeeds more as a study of character.,592
True Crime,"The story drifts away, and the movie is structured in a conventional way that lets us know it won't end tragically.",592
True Crime,"Eastwood handles it professionally, intelligently, and beautifully.",592
True Crime,Hard https://dennisschwartzreviews.com/to swallow.,592
True Crime,Few films cheapen their own material so blatantly.,592
True Crime,A riveting and moral drama about an antihero who comes through despite all his flaws.,592
True Crime,"This is the old gritty Clint -- the ""Do you feel lucky punk?"" Clint.",592
True Crime,"A respectable film, particularly in its unequivocal details involving the characters and genuinely unpredictable outcome.",592
Heavy,A likeable and loud outsider comedy that has metal in its heart and its heart on its sleeve. Turn it up to 11.,594
Heavy,"Jagged, scattered, unevenly paced and constructed, and occasionally uncertain in overall direction, ""Heavy Trip"" still delivers a damn fine time, peaking with moments of absurd metal glory, both for those who head bang and those who don't.",594
Heavy,"The film is fun the watch, the music heavy as it should be, and the whole thing is a riotous fun package perfect for a Saturday night out.",594
Heavy,One of the funniest buddy films of the year.,594
Heavy,"Not everyone will be able to find the rhythm that Heavy Trip is drumming, but once you do it's futile not to drum along.",594
Heavy,"If you can, see this one with an audience where the laughs from your fellow film-goers will surely elevate this slapstick rock comedy to an eleven.",594
Heavy,"Tune in, Turn off, and just go with it - Heavy Trip is a hilarious home for outcasts and misfits. A laugh riot for the rebellious, and call-to-arms for the underdog.",594
Heavy,"For anyone that's ever played in a garage band and remembers things like pre-show jitters, schlepping equipment to and from the venue, and the importance of a good promotional photo, Heavy Trip should resonate particularly well.",594
Heavy,"Heavy Trip is an absurdist, powerhouse folly, which feels spunky enough to honor the musical genre and comes filled with deadpan hilarity to please comedy addicts.",594
Heavy,"Heavy Trip ought to appeal to a wider audience than Lords of Chaos, as the bar for entry in terms of prior knowledge (and stomach fortitude) is much lower. It's also just a likeable story.",594
"Fan, The","The film is rather more decorative to look at than such Anglo-Saxon equivalents as The Crimson Pirate, but Christian Jaque's opulent, heavy-handed manner tends to sacrifice wit and elegance to some only moderately entertaining burlesque heroics.",595
"Fan, The",[A] delightfully funny sendup of swashbuckler movies...,595
"Fan, The","Even though the film moves at a snappy pace, its story still doesn't move fast enough.",595
"Fan, The",Tiresomely tireless escapade.,595
"Fan, The","You get a sense not only of Philipe's professional training, which clearly honed his skills in choreography and movement, but also of his natural charms. That the actor performs so effortlessly, so casually, is the real magic here.",595
"Fan, The","Starring the go-to couple of Grard Philipe and Gina Lollobrigida, it features duels, chases and low-cut costumes, all in glorious black and white.",595
"Fan, The",...a perfectly jolly swashbuckler...if a bit dated.,595
"Fan, The",Enjoyable but undeniably creaky; what played as glorious period tomfoolery to European festival juries and discerning U S audiences in the early 1950s now just seems quaintly pleased with itself.,595
"Fan, The","Christian-Jaque gets a bouquet for his effort, even though it's just this side of being complete.",595
"Fan, The","Cahiers-savvy cinephiles will recognize Fanfan as the type of handsome prestige production that the French New Wave overthrew in the early '60s, but this example of the 'cinma de qualit' is hardly a musty artifact.",595
"Hunchback of Notre Dame, The",Alan Menken’s songs rank among some of the best work he has ever done...,596
"Hunchback of Notre Dame, The","You're quickly won over by the movie's subversive wit, swept along by its narrative bravado and its enormous visual energy. This new ""Hunchback"" is a triumph on its own terms, and on any other terms that might come to mind.",596
"Hunchback of Notre Dame, The","The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a bold effort with some of the strongest uses of size and scale in Disney history. The entire film, however, fails to land with a distracted and ineffective voice.",596
"Hunchback of Notre Dame, The",This is the darkest “G” movie of all time! It’s like the Bambi’s mom scene for 90 minutes!,596
"Hunchback of Notre Dame, The","It is a great paradox, a film denied commercial success because of its darker themes, but a film that succeeds artistically for those very reasons.",596
"Hunchback of Notre Dame, The",The messages in the movie are very muddled.,596
"Hunchback of Notre Dame, The","A better title for the film would have been Beauty and the Beast, but Disney's already done that -- which may be why Alan Menken's score sounds like warmed over off-cuts from its predecessor.",596
"Hunchback of Notre Dame, The","These ideas are presented with effective songs and, yes, tasteful bits of humor.",596
"Hunchback of Notre Dame, The","As my wife put it, The Hunchback of Notre Dame is ""too dark and too dirty for kids.""",596
"Hunchback of Notre Dame, The",One of the absolute best of Disney's animated legacy. It approaches the ideas of accepting others for who they are and not allowing antiquated notions of propriety destroy lives.,596
Eraser,"Most of Eraser consists of Schwarzenegger and Williams dodging bullets and bad guys, but director Chuck Russell doesn't put much effort into the action scenes: He simply points the camera and shoots.",597
Eraser,"I think Eraser (1996), directed by Chuck Russell and co-starring James Caan and Vanessa Williams, is the first large-scale Schwarzenegger film that nobody cared about.",597
Eraser,"Tree trunk he may be, but Mr. Schwarzenegger has grown new branches with green leaves in this smart action thriller, directed with panache by Charles Russell and written crisply by Tony Puryear and Walon Green.",597
Eraser,...delivers exactly what one might’ve anticipated (and hoped for) based on the premise.,597
Eraser,"A few of the set pieces are fussy or overly extended, but the rest is tolerable bone-crunching diversion.",597
Eraser,"I know it sounds very predictable, but it's actually better than you expect and Vanessa makes it much more tolerable.",597
Eraser,Spectacle above all else. [Full review in Spanish],597
Eraser,Defying the boundaries of realism - by walking a fine line between amusing and obnoxious - always seems easy for Arnold.,597
Eraser,"Although Eraser offered the first signs that cinema audiences were no longer willing to swallow Arnie in any old action vehicle served up to them, there is still enough cheesy lowbrow moments to make this tale... deliver on the small screen.",597
Eraser,'90s Schwarzenegger action movie is extremely violent.,597
"Big Squeeze, The",Shows how even morally bankrupt individuals can suddenly find themselves to be miracle workers.,598
"Big Squeeze, The","[It has] a story that feels like a 1930s screwball comedy, but is set in the present day and, even more incredibly, doesn't seem to know it's a comedy. It plays its contrived story perfectly straight, as if events like this could happen.",598
Police Story 4: Project S,"Jackie Chan's First Strike is kung-foolishness of a very entertaining sort, and action fans will get a kick out of it.",599
Police Story 4: Project S,"All the action and laughs that one would expect from a Police Story film--or, for that matter, a Jackie Chan film--are in full view here.",599
Police Story 4: Project S,The climactic shark-tank fight is a masterpiece of choreography,599
Police Story 4: Project S,"Here is crucial dialogue from early in Jackie Chan's First Strike': ""It's me! I found new suspect!'' ""Who is he?'' ""I don't know!'' Right there you have the beauty of the Jackie Chan movies.",599
Police Story 4: Project S,"There's definitely more than three rings' worth of death-defying feats, high-flying slapstick and even a few well-trained animal acts.",599

Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe,Laughable,600
For Whom the Bell Tolls,"A few carping critics have said that Mr. Hemingway's novel, while proving to be his finest work, should never have been more than a short story. The screen treatment seems to bear this out.",601
For Whom the Bell Tolls,"We never know for whom the bell tolls, or why, or how. Everything is reduced to a love story and to another story about how to blow up a bridge. [Full Review in Spanish]",601
For Whom the Bell Tolls,"The rhythm of this film, in fact, is the most defective I have ever seen in a superproduction.",601
For Whom the Bell Tolls,"Not horrible, but if you really want to know this story, don't bother with the movie at all. Go out and read the book.",601
For Whom the Bell Tolls,"Though diffuse and overlong, and its politics vague, the film's star performances of Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper are appealing; Hemingway wrote the novel with Coop in mind.",601
For Whom the Bell Tolls,Ingrid Bergman in an unusual role as an enabler to stoic Cooper during the Spanish Civil War.,601
For Whom the Bell Tolls,Overlong and not wholly convincing,601
For Whom the Bell Tolls,Cooper is great as the knowing and weary Robert.,601
"American in Paris, An","Vincente Minnelli’s dreamlike musical, An American in Paris, paired the catchy tunes of George and Ira Gershwin with the electric charisma of Gene Kelly. The result is a mesmerizing and romantic anecdote... radical at the time and iconic to this day.",602
"American in Paris, An",Free yourself from being disappointed by this overrated white elephant.,602
"American in Paris, An",Some of the greatest singing and dancing ever in film,602
"American in Paris, An","Conspicuous among its merits is Gene Kelly, pretending to be an ambitious young artist and dancing with a professional that is unmistakably genuine.",602
"American in Paris, An","Minnelli, whose gifts as a director have never been better used, gives an admirably varied pace to the story; there are few moments which are not immensely enjoyable.",602
"American in Paris, An","The best film musical Hollywood has dished up in years. From beginning to end, this lavish Technicolor production rates superior.",602
"American in Paris, An","Virtues abound -- an all-Gershwin score, a likely tale, adept Gene Kelly, a delightful newcomer named Leslie Caron, a windup of dancing before imaginative settings and over all a spirit of crisp originality and sophistication.",602
"American in Paris, An","Too fancy and overblown, but the two dancing lovers have infectious grins and the Gershwin music keeps everything good-spirited.",602
"American in Paris, An","The George Gershwin score is enough in itself to make the film a hit. With Gene Kelly tapping out captivating routines, and wry-faced Oscar Levant banging the piano it has added appeal.",602
"American in Paris, An",Gene Kelly -- star and choreographer -- never lets the jig-time slacken. The picture runs up the stairs and dances down the street. It never rests.,602
Rear Window,"Rear Window is magnificent for a multitude of reasons. It has withstood the test of time, and no facet has lost an ounce of effectiveness. As a primer into Hitchcock’s vast, varied, and essential oeuvre, it is the perfect starting point.",603
Rear Window,"Rear Window may be the best of Hitchcock’s films. It has so many devious moves and machinations, but doesn’t ever leave the single location it’s in.",603
Rear Window,A clear game of suspense. [Full review in Spanish],603
Rear Window,"Mixing drama, with a bit of dry comedy, and the thriller elements to which Hitchcock had accustomed us, ""Rear Window"" is one of the best films of his filmography, and an interesting metatextual commentary on voyeurism. Full review in Spanish.",603
Rear Window,The Oscar-nominated Rear Window isn't just one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films but one of the greatest thrillers ever made.,603
Rear Window,"Some of the most immaculate filmmaking in Hitchcock's career, which by default makes it some of the most immaculate filmmaking in the history of the medium.",603
Rear Window,Perhaps the most elegant and satisfying of Alfred Hitchcock’s thrillers...,603
Rear Window,It’s straightforward and mysterious at the same time and features characters that are more complex than they appear on the surface.,603
Rear Window,"Psycho may be more daring and thrilling (and ultimately better), and Vertigo certainly has its fans for its unique stylings and deep themes, but Rear Window is the quintessential Hitchcock film.",603
Rear Window,"One of the defining characteristics of Alfred Hitchcocks cinematic oeuvre is his constant need to innovate and iterate on ideas, taking audiences to new and compelling places. Rear Window is not his most ambitious gimmick, but it is his most successful.",603
It Happened One Night,"Really, what makes It Happened One Night special is that—unlike the rom-coms that followed in its wake—it doesn’t have to be in conversation with what it means to “be a rom-com.”",604
It Happened One Night,"The grandaddy of all rom-coms is this ingenious, fabulously smutty and still relevant 90-year-old two-hander.",604
It Happened One Night,"Considering its subject, it is better than it has any right to be -- better acted, better directed, better written.",604
It Happened One Night,"Satisfying and romantic, the chemistry between Gable and Colbert is unmatched.",604
It Happened One Night,...It Happened One Night remains one of the greatest romantic comedies ever made.,604
It Happened One Night,"The two stars interact with easy, on-the-button timing; Gable has a gift for seeming virile even at his most foolish, and when things go wrong Colbert manages to look starry-eyed and blankly depressed at the same time.",604
It Happened One Night,"The acting provides deceit, romance and comedy in a grandiose way. But it's inevitable to feel that time has gone by and through It Happened One Night's narrative efforts. [Full review in Spanish]",604
It Happened One Night,"After nearly a century of critics, scholars, and moviegoers singing its praises, the answer to what makes the film endure remains simple, if rather dissatisfying: Movie Magic.",604
It Happened One Night,"Boy, howdy, this is one that you cannot afford to miss.",604
It Happened One Night,"I have not enjoyed a film so much for a long time as I did It Happened One Night, a really delightful comedy-drama featuring Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable.",604
Meet Me in St. Louis,Vincent Minelli’s first Technicolor film is the ultimate in Hollywood Americana and a masterful musical that turned Judy Garland into a true leading lady.,605
Meet Me in St. Louis,"If you were born and brought up in St. Louis, and aware from earliest childhood of The Fair... then the picture will seem even more like watching the youth of your parents and aunts and uncles, and it is all just as they told you.",605
Meet Me in St. Louis,Practically every member of the family from the 5-year-olds to grandma will find entertainment and fun.,605
Meet Me in St. Louis,Altogether the picture will give you an exhilarated feeling and a sense of well being plus an appreciation for this bright bit of Americana.,605
Meet Me in St. Louis,"This amusing 1903 vignette, decorated with tunes, Technicolor and a practically perfect cast, is ideal holiday entertainment in which Judy Garland and little Margaret O'Brien romp off with both your heart and most of the honors.",605
Meet Me in St. Louis,"Meet Me in St. Louis is gay, and quaint, and tuneful as a music box and excellent entertainment for any one of any age.",605
Meet Me in St. Louis,"Vincente Minnelli has been sensible about directing Meet Me in St. Louis. He didn't go out of his way to spill tears, or even try hard for laughs -- he just let things take their course.",605
Meet Me in St. Louis,"It’s a picture that will bring tears to your eyes, but send you away proud of them. It’s also a picture whose principal appeal hinges on a store of wonderful youthful memories which you probably thought you had forgotten.",605
Meet Me in St. Louis,"It's a delight, pure and simple spelling a restful, pleasant evening in the theater. Nostalgic, colorful, alive and human.",605
Meet Me in St. Louis,"It is a tuneful, merry comedy-drama, which is so wholesome and heart- warming that few will be able to resist its appeal.",605
All About Eve,"The barbed dialogue is witty and wonderful, delivered with tart insolence by Bette Davis as ... an aging Broadway lioness who watches ruthless cub Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) pull out her claws as she purrs and insinuates herself into stardom.",606
All About Eve,"A penetrating anecdote on the viciousness of narcissism, cynicism, deceit, and celebrity, All About Eve is one of the most revolutionary and sharp-edged screenplays ever written.",606
All About Eve,All About Eve proved to Hollywood that Bette Davis wasn't ready to quit and it remains one of the greatest films ever made.,606
All About Eve,"The writing and directing by Joseph L. Mankiewicz are superb, and the acting is Academy-Award all the way.",606
All About Eve,"It is a very long piece, and it often seems long, though never when Bette Davis is on the screen; Miss Davis as the Broadway star, insolent, stormy, waspish and terrified of growing old, is magnificent.",606
All About Eve,"Joseph L. Mankiewicz's bad taste, exhibited with verve, is more fun than careful, mousy, dehydrated good taste. His nonsense about ""theatre"" is saved by one performance that is the real thing: Bette Davis is at her most instinctive and assured.",606
All About Eve,You'll want to see All Abut Eve a couple of times.,606
All About Eve,Bette Davis has never done anything better.,606
All About Eve,"The script is well capable of carrying out the film's intentions -- it is, indeed, an admirable piece of work and not lacking in wit.",606
All About Eve,"It has been a long time since the screen has offered us anything as adult, as full of insight, or (in the favorable sense of the word) as sophisticated as All About Eve.",606
Rebecca,"If Wheatley and his team had found a way to inject some of that delicious moral ambivalence into the veins of the film, Rebecca might be more worthwhile.",607
Rebecca,The thirst for a sinister and mysterious Rebecca is a thirst that is never quenched.,607
Rebecca,"Rebecca feels sanded out, erased of all imperfection, identity and mystery.",607
Rebecca,"The casting is not the Wheatley Rebecca’s biggest problem, but it certainly doesn’t help.",607
Rebecca,Netflix’s version of Rebecca gets lost in trying to balance so many genres in just one film.,607
Rebecca,"Knowing very little about the original novel or other adaptations, I thoroughly enjoyed watching Rebecca. Not having the titular character physically appear but still having her be a major force in the film was done extremely well.",607
Rebecca,Maybe Mrs. Danvers was right. This Rebecca has us longing for the original.,607
Rebecca,"It maintains a wonderful period feel thanks to Julian Day’s costumes and Katie Spencer’s set design. Laurie Rose’s stellar cinematography vividly captures the beautiful sun-soaked Monte Carlo as well as the gloomy, atmospheric Mandeley.",607
Rebecca,"Ben Wheatleys Rebecca really fails to distinguish itself, ending up another by-the-numbers remake to be lost in streaming queues.",607
Rebecca,"While Rebecca will certainly not remove the sentiment from cinephiles wondering why a new remake was necessary, Wheatleys take surpasses the quality of the Psycho and Rear Window remakes.",607
Spellbound,"A solid if fairly derivative attempt to steal Disney’s thunder. There’s enough pep and vigour here to keep kids interested, if not quite enough for the grown-ups.",608
Spellbound,"So, too, may viewers of ""Spellbound"" occasionally sense the enchantment zones of their brains lighting up, more as a reflexive response to dim memories of past animated features than as a genuine reaction to the derivative pastiche onscreen.",608
Spellbound,Spellbound is more enchantment than curse.,608
Spellbound,"Skydance is a puzzlement. They have more money than Daddy Warbucks and a lot of talented people working there. And yet their first film, Luck, was terrible and this one is not a lot better.",608
Spellbound,"An often lovely animated tale with some wonderful, fun songs that deals with issues normally reserved for some of the best of our live-action family tales like E.T. and Where The Wild Things Are.",608
Spellbound,It fails to get the magic needed to be convincing.,608
Spellbound,Even Wish is more competently made and more worthwhile to watch than this.,608
Spellbound,"Spellbound is not quite as insightful or emotionally resonant as the top-tier animated children's films. But it's a cute, fun adventure that younger audiences will still have a blast with.",608
Spellbound,In an ambitious and exciting age of animation this isn't good enough. Totally generic,608
Spellbound,Zegler puts her amazing vocal range to great use in a playbook of quality songs from Alan Menken and Glenn Slater.,608
Father of the Bride,"Despite the cliches, shameless sentimentality and rampant unsubtlety, it’s an engagingly enjoyable comedy tear-jerker.",609
Father of the Bride,My favorite performance from Steve Martin especially the scene where he flips out over hot dogs,609
Father of the Bride,"Beyond its personally threatening nature, and its unnerving idea about laying out a life's hoardings for a single unrewarding day, this new version of the romantic comedy first filmed by Vincente Minnelli in 1950 feels false.",609
Father of the Bride,The film's sole dramatic preoccupations are with broad physical comedy and unrealistically offbeat characterizations; a few moments of nominal pathos are really just structural pauses in the joke series.,609
Father of the Bride,The strengths of these films are not so much laughs as sincerity and heart. [Blu-ray],609
Father of the Bride,"""Father of the Bride"" should bring a smile to anyone who's been in a family that's had a wedding-regardless of your point of view. But the sequel doesn't offer quite the same level of comedy and insight.",609
Father of the Bride,"Neither the '90s nor the husband-wife team of Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer (they wrote the new version, she co-produced, he directed) can match the original film's grace or wit.",609
Father of the Bride,"The film belongs to Steve Martin, whose crisp, almost bitter delivery, although frequently off-putting, manages to put an edge to a film that, without him, would be mush.",609
Father of the Bride,"The film does work, but not quite as well as the Hepburn-Tracy classic that it seeks to replace. Mildly amusing.",609
Father of the Bride,"A charming, if pointless remake of the Spencer Tracy classic.",609
Gigi,"A gorgeous and colorful Parisian romp, though the musical that won the 1958 Oscar for Best Picture hasn't aged particularly well, especially in its gender dynamics.",610
Gigi,"Nobody captures Parisian romantic musicals quite like Vincente Minnelli did, so if you can get past the huge gap in age differences (she’s only 16), there is a lot of charm and beauty in the film.",610
Gigi,"Gigi is spontaneous and uncalculating, her company fun precisely because there is no gamesmanship of sexual tension.",610
Gigi,"Cecil Beaton, E. Preston Ames, F. Keogh Gleason, and Henry Grace were all credited as costume designers and they all did terrific work.",610
Gigi,"Most of Gigi is in the Hollywood “big production"" style at its most handsome and vivacious -- expensive froth carbonated by experts.",610
Gigi,"Nine songs, sentimental and sardonic, and high-spirited, illustrate, decorate, amplify and develop the plot... They have the trick of singing in one's head without driving one off it, which marks the good popular tune. I find them captivating.",610
Gigi,"Vincente Minnelli directed, in a confident, confectionery style.",610
Gigi,Gigi has more imaginative use of cinema than all our recent pseudo-realist movies put together.,610
Gigi,"Gigi calls for all the carefree superlatives in the reviewer's usually begrudged lexicon: captivating, delightful, charming, touching, exhilarating.",610
Gigi,The Cecil Beaton costumes and settings add to the charm of a package that is going to be enjoyed by everyone in the family.,610
Laura,"... elegance incarnate in a genre known for its hard edge, the sleekest, silkiest noir of all.",611
Laura,"Onscreen, Tierney plays an icon who entrances everyone around her, but the performer's life off-camera lends the role tragic insight that makes the film unforgettable.",611
Laura,...piles up the intrigue and obsession.,611
Laura,"Rounded off with haunting theme music and sharp black-and-white cinematography (which took home an Oscar), this is a positively top-notch film noir.",611
Laura,"Murder, as we say, has not looked so attractive in several seasons.",611
Laura,"A masterly mix of expressionism and street realism, this ranks among the undisputed masterpieces of German silent cinema.",611
Laura,What remains of Laura is not only the ability of the scriptwriters and director to keep the mystery of the film noir but the originality of the dramatic structure and the attempt to delve into the psychological characteristics. [Full Review in Spanish],611
Laura,"It's one of the smartest of all noirs, and thus among the most enticingly savage and dangerous.",611
Laura,A feverish trance wrapped in a deadpan investigation,611
Laura,"Preminger deals in facades, with how perception cheats us, right down to the ideal image of Laura as a portrait. (Cinmathque Annotations on Film)",611
Lost Horizon,This is a movie that shows Ronald Coleman at his very best.,612
Lost Horizon,"A very handsome, often exciting, and occasionally preposterous film. With Ronald Colman. Young people will enjoy the adventure sequences, which are superb.",612
Lost Horizon,"A thought-provoking drama that's worth watching if for no other reason than to be aware of this culturally significant film. It did, after all, give us the name 'Shangri-La,' which has since become synonymous with a utopian paradise on earth.",612
Lost Horizon,"Great directors are perhaps best understood by their failures, and such is the case with ""Lost Horizon.",612
Lost Horizon,Capra's most challenging film is both naive and pleasantly uplifting.,612
Lost Horizon,"Boasting great production values, Frank Capra's film is still one of the most cherished fables made during the Depression era.",612
Lost Horizon,"Classic Capra fantasy. Not wholly successful, but essential viewing.",612
Lost Horizon,"Lost Horizon (1937) is a timeless, widely-acclaimed classic - a romantic fantasy and science-fiction adventure film, produced and directed by Frank Capra for Columbia Pictures. The film was faithfully adapted by screenwriter Robert Riskin",612
My Man Godfrey,'…My Man Godfrey’s class critique stings…La Cava’s comedy has more social relevance that a dozen ‘prestige’ pictures…’,613
My Man Godfrey,This scintillating comedy was the first film to be Oscar-nominated in all four acting categories.,613
My Man Godfrey,It is a wonderful film with a conscientious mind.,613
My Man Godfrey,"It remains one of the very best screwball comedies of the era, as well as one of the greatest movies ever made.",613
My Man Godfrey,"An excellent farce, given an extremely lavish production; it should keep audiences laughing from the beginning to the very end.",613
My Man Godfrey,Arguably the best of these reliably eat-the-rich films...the film's satirical edge emerges from its pillorying of the propertied classes and the empty promise of economic recovery.,613
My Man Godfrey,"A frothy, frivolous farce...",613
My Man Godfrey,"It then turned out that My Man Godfrey was really about the class-struggle, not the best subject in the world for comedy. Best not to stay for the ending. It leaves you with the feeling that the whole thing was a waste of time.",613
My Man Godfrey,"While My Man Godfrey is full of witty dialogue and classical direction, it's the film's social awareness that really stands out today.",613
My Man Godfrey,"Gregory La Cava's warm and giddy carousel, a raucous burlesque with a beautiful still center, a lighter and tarter savior fable than Capra's concurrent transmutations of the Gospels",613
Giant,The Iron Giant more than holds up over a quarter-century after its release.,614
Giant,Brad Bird’s cartoon fable in science fiction clothing and fairy tale trappings is a delightful throwback to the classic era of hand-drawn animated movies and delivers the most amazing little boy wish fulfillment fantasies.,614
Giant,The characters are far more complex than most animated fare.,614
Giant,"Fuses Cold War paranoia with a science-fiction/horror B-movie template to create an entertaining, action-filled, and clearly disclosed parable.",614
Giant,...an incredible achievement in both narrative and animation.,614
Giant,"I found The Iron Giant to be a completely engaging movie experience. I laughed. And, yes, I cried, too. Moreover, I felt like I'd really gotten my money's worth when I left the theater after watching it.",614
Giant,"The Iron Giant should have been immediately recognized as a near-perfect, classical expression of imagination, combining childlike wonder and adult sophistication.",614

Giant,It is beautiful and moving and the animation is gorgeous.,614
"39 Steps, The","... an effortless balance of romance and adventure set against a picaresque landscape populated by eccentrics and social register smoothies, none of whom what they appear to be.",615
"39 Steps, The",From an absolutely dull adventure story -- The Thirty-nine Steps by John Buchan -- Hitchcock has drawn a good film. He has invented episodes. He has inserted wittiness and mischievousness where the original contained only heroism.,615
"39 Steps, The","[Hitchcock] tells the story clearly and convincingly and the wildly melodramatic moments are in part offset by such well observed sequences as the Scottish political meeting, the Forth Bridge episode, and the discreetly managed scene in the inn bedroom.",615
"39 Steps, The","A noteworthy example of Hitchcock's early thrillers, riddled with plotting, backstabbing, clever twists, and the big reveal of the meaning behind the title.",615
"39 Steps, The","The 39 Steps transcends the time period: part Bond movie, part comedic caper, and anchored by a performance that feels Ryan Goslingian, it's a black-and-white movie that feels alive and contemporary.",615
"39 Steps, The","Made in England 1935, 'The 39 Steps' isn't the first Hitchcock film constructed around ""the wrong man"" conceit, but it's one where he found his touch.",615
"39 Steps, The",It's a gripping entertainment.,615
"39 Steps, The",The 39 Steps is as polite as Geneva and as wicked as a dozen G-men pictures in one.,615
"39 Steps, The","The newest Gaumont British importation, The 39 Steps, should prove pretty conclusively that Alfred Hitchcock is the finest native director in England.",615
"39 Steps, The","The 39 Steps is light, urbane, sexy as hell, and as so much of Hitchcock was so often, right about everything.",615
Night of the Living Dead,"Clumsily shot, awkwardly acted and as for being scary, completely ineffective.",616
Night of the Living Dead,"Romero’s distrust of authority is reflected in the ending, with cops brandishing guns and German shepherds on taut leashes carrying out extrajudicial executions conjuring the imagery of then contemporaneous civil rights marches under siege by the police.",616
Night of the Living Dead,"Made for almost nothing, the timing of the release certainly helped its release as it seemed to be an allegory for what was happening in America at the time...",616
Night of the Living Dead,The gory zombiefest remains hugely influential.,616
Night of the Living Dead,The cruel and abrupt ending is still shattering and feels even more depressingly plausible today.,616
Night of the Living Dead,.... there’s no horror film really like this in ’68 and everything after is merely trying to refine what Romero accomplished ...,616
Night of the Living Dead,... A must-see for film fans.,616
Night of the Living Dead,Each glorious 35mm black-and-white frame represented a bold new step for independent filmmaking and for horror movies in general.,616
Night of the Living Dead,"Beyond discussions of social commentary and cultural reflectivity, the timelessness of its allegories, and the stark suggestions made by the visual presentation, Night of the Living Dead is great entertainment.",616
Night of the Living Dead,It is not only the legacy that Night of the Living Dead leaves that makes it a classic but also its examination of the instant removal of humanity.,616
"Blue Angel, The",The Blue Angel launched a legendary collaboration between Josef von Sternberg and Marlene Dietrich in Hollywood.,617
"Blue Angel, The","It Is a great role for Emil Jannings -- one of his best... Miss Dietrich Is all that she should be in the role of the cruel enchantress, Lola, although it did seem to us that the vulgar side of the part had been unnecessarily overdone.",617
"Blue Angel, The",Its success is guaranteed. [Full Review in Spanish],617
"Blue Angel, The",There can be few moments in the cinema more truly horrible than the scene when the ruined professor shambles on to the stage of the disreputable tavern.,617
"Blue Angel, The",Emil Jannings portrays this role superbly... This surely is one of the finest examples of tragic acting yet furnished from the screen.,617
"Blue Angel, The","...part exploitation piece, part morality tale.",617
"Blue Angel, The","Unlike the monsters of Murnau and Wiene, Blue Angel's light is equal to its darkness",617
"Blue Angel, The","Once the party's over, the money's lost and the humiliation has set in, what leader, what purifying force can rescue everyone from this devastating shame, while supplying something of the same erotic, exalting excitement?",617
"Blue Angel, The",The classic tale of amour fou still holds up over eighty years later.,617
"Blue Angel, The",American director Josef von Sternberg went to Germany to direct Emil Jannings in his transition from silent to sound cinema and returned to Hollywood with an international hit and a new star: Marlene Dietrich.,617
Picnic,A brilliantly ambiguous film about ambiguity.,618
Picnic,"The “readings” are endless, the mood impossibly eerie and the legacy untouchable.",618
Picnic,A heavily atmospheric drama steeped in sexual imagery and ideas.,618
Picnic,"Extraordinary, haunting classic...",618
Picnic,"It is an unexplained mystery thriller that is exotic, erotic and exquisite.",618
Picnic,"The sheer mystery of the disappearance and the search for answers is fundamental, but Weir makes the emotional aftermath just as compelling.",618
Picnic,[Picnic at Hanging Rock's] use of music is especially effective.,618
Picnic,"Weir makes beautiful and daring movies, but this one is longer on style than substance.",618
Picnic,"The film's slow pacing... detracts from and defuses what is in other respects, one of the more interesting screen imaginations at work today.",618
Picnic,"""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is lush, gorgeous, Gothic and at times plotted tighter than a corset.",618
Extreme Measures,...a solid medical thriller that's lamentably been forgotten in the years since its 1996 theatrical release.,619
Extreme Measures,It's a fish out of water story in which neither the fish nor anybody else seems aware of his 'out of water' status.,619
Extreme Measures,"The good liberal Michael Apted seems to think he's directing a film about society's exploitation of the homeless. In fact, the exploitation is all his.",619
Extreme Measures,"If it's never as scary or provocative as it means to be, at least it's straightforward and satisfying.",619
Extreme Measures,"A spine-tingling suspense machine that holds you captivated from beginning to end. A much underrated, overlooked thriller.",619
Extreme Measures,"Extreme silliness, but kind of fun.",619
Extreme Measures,"Tries to be a both a medical thriller and morality play, and it doesn't quite deliver in both departments.",619
Extreme Measures,A thoughtful if somewhat heavy-handed medical thriller that benefits enormously from Hackman's involvement.,619
Extreme Measures,Opens our eyes to some serious moral issues involving advances in medical science.,619
Extreme Measures,"Hackman and Grant make a surprisingly watchable pair, but there's yawns to be found.",619
"Chamber, The",I don't know the source material but it's incredibly long and slow for a non-Harry Potter fan. I wish it were more engaging and eventful.,620
"Chamber, The","Like the previous entry, the pacing in this is rough. Chris Columbus makes this a bit too light in tone given the stakes and events that take place in this story, which is frustrating.",620
"Chamber, The","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets triumphs by combining a murder mystery with politics, class division and social commentary. Daniel Radcliffe also evolves displaying a self-assurance that ensures this sequel genuinely delivers.",620
"Chamber, The",...a watchable (and impressively faithful) adaptation that never quite becomes as captivating or engrossing as one might've hoped...,620
"Chamber, The","Rather than better or worse, the films were almost an extension of the books, wonderfully bringing to life JK Rowling's fantastical Wizarding World as the definitive franchise an entire generation grew up with.",620
"Chamber, The","This time around, the humor and family-friendly fun can't overcome the annoying supporting characters and repetition from the previous picture.",620
"Chamber, The",Brilliant stuff.,620
"Chamber, The","At 162 minutes, this sounds like a long film, but the time passes quickly...almost too quickly. A technical and visual masterpiece.",620
"Chamber, The",Good film directed for a teenage audience in which not only is magic taught but also how stereotypes affect it while the film itself recreates some British stereotypes. [Review in Spanish],620
"Chamber, The","This time, the adventures of the world's most famous young wizard come mixed with a stiff dose of the menacing.",620
"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier",Legend of famous hero; some outdated cultural references.,621
"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier","Walt Disney's amiable biography of the renowned American frontiersman is intended chiefly for youngsters, of course, but many a grown-up is likely to get quite a kick out of it too.",621
"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier","Feature version of three TV Disney episodes still fun, exciting",621
Swiss Family Robinson,"As a tale of hardship and pioneer pluck, the tale is pure fantasy, but as entertainment its energetic and appealing.",622
Swiss Family Robinson,"The famous 1813 novel by Johann Wyss has been turned into a fine adventure film under Walt Disney's supervision, although purists may resent the way the original narrative has been souped up with pirates and other innovations.",622
Swiss Family Robinson,"This feels like a believable family, even if the treehouse is a little over the top.",622
Swiss Family Robinson,"...a crudely calibrated series of 'thrills,' each timed for maximum sustained interest.",622
Swiss Family Robinson,"Mild peril, dated animation in tale of island survival.",622
Swiss Family Robinson,Good intro for kids reluctant to watch old movies.,622
Swiss Family Robinson,"There's something for everybody in this Disney's live action adventure made for the entire family, which may explain why it was the most commercially popular film of 1960.",622
Swiss Family Robinson,"The Swiss Family Robinson, like most of Walt Disney's screen versions of the children's classics, is good Disney and bad culture.",622
Swiss Family Robinson,"It's no Pirates Of The Caribbean but the spirit of adventure, and Disney's high production values, means that there's still some fun to be had watching this wholesome family adapt to island life.",622
Swiss Family Robinson,"Chock-full of exotic locations and animals, desert-island DIY ingenuity, and high-spirited excitement, with a poignant subplot involving the rivalry of the two elder sons.",622
Angels in the Outfield,"Angels in the Outfield otherwise does its best and despite the slapstick comedy of it all, it really is the weakest baseball film of the early 1990s.",623
Angels in the Outfield,All the players have to do is quit swearing and believe in themselves. How pious.,623
Angels in the Outfield,A Disney-fied morality play complete with corn and sniffles.,623
Angels in the Outfield,"It's sickly sweet, but undemanding children may be entertained.",623
Angels in the Outfield,"As a pleasant little summer diversion, ""Angels in the Outfield'' is about what it should be.",623
Angels in the Outfield,See Little Big League instead.,623
Angels in the Outfield,Serves up its corn so unabashedly it's hard to take offense at its sappiness.,623
Angels in the Outfield,Uplifting (for some) fantasy-comedy-drama. Stick with original version from 1950s.,623
Angels in the Outfield,A sugary and sickening Disney remake...,623
Angels in the Outfield,"Serviceable, but why does Tony Danza have to die?",623
"Three Caballeros, The",...the movie benefits from its predictably sterling animation and smattering of legitimately memorable digressions...,624
"Three Caballeros, The","While it is hard to say the film ultimately demands to be seen in the wider context of what Disney has created over the last century, those looking for something new will undoubtedly find something of value within The Three Caballeros!",624
"Three Caballeros, The",...in the running for the most rambunctiously-surreal thing ever issued by the studio...,624
"Three Caballeros, The",In those small doses it could be very charming but as a movie it is tough.,624
"Three Caballeros, The",less of a propaganda piece and more of a narrative story,624
"Three Caballeros, The","That rare event, a Disney failure.",624
"Three Caballeros, The","By far the strangest feature-length movie in the history of the Walt Disney Company, with virtually every new minute bringing something more insanely creative than the last.",624
"Three Caballeros, The","It's a gay, colorful, resplendent conceit.",624
"Three Caballeros, The",This is one of the most dazzling achievements of the cartoon genre.,624
"Three Caballeros, The",The two films are as artistically astonishing as they are culturally clueless.,624
"Sword in the Stone, The","While Disney has had some misses, few are as obvious and consistent as The Sword in the Stone.",625
"Sword in the Stone, The","Those who enjoy Disney animation, as I do (I have all but seven of Disney’s animated features on video cassette), may take special liking to this feature with its crazy villainess, but may feel a bit let down in the plot area.",625
"Sword in the Stone, The","Aside from the owl Archimedes, none of the characters make any impression whatsoever.",625
"Sword in the Stone, The","The 2D animation looks splendid, if not up to the heights of previous Disney animated affairs. The antics of playful animals appeal to the child in all of us, while the story moves at a good pace and varies pleasantly from Arthur-ian expectations",625
"Sword in the Stone, The","The songs are not of the usual caliber and are quickly forgotten; however, the score itself is melodious and dramatic.",625
"Sword in the Stone, The","The show is stolen by Merlin's arch enemy, an uproarious witch and quickchange artist named Mad Madam Mim.",625
"Sword in the Stone, The",The songs are so-so and the messages in the picture feel like an after school special instead of part of the story.,625
"Sword in the Stone, The","...a movie about Arthurian legend that had the misfortune of being released on December 25, just a month after America's version of Camelot died with President John F. Kennedy.",625
"Sword in the Stone, The",Delightful classic brings Arthur legend to life.,625
"Sword in the Stone, The",Well animated yet thoroughly tedious...,625
So Dear to My Heart,"Suffocatingly cozy, [but] it comes by it honestly.",626
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,[A] spirited adventure.,627
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,The result is that Kevin Costner is... completely out of place. [Full review in Spanish],627
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"Adds up to an enjoyable reimagining of the familiar Robin Hood mythology, filled with a deep cast- if you can get past Costner's accent (30th anniversary)",627
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,The biggest shock throughout the picture is the continually shifting tone - fueled by bizarre additives entirely foreign to standard interpretations.,627
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves certainly boasts many of the qualities that one has come to expect from such an endeavor...,627
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"Rickman's casualness is the unwitting emblem of this silly, but enjoyable, Hollywood romp from yesteryear.",627
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an entertainment without a particular point of view.,627
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"While the makers of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves may have set out to bury the poor old duffer of Sherwood Forest in a welter of trendy banter, they have ended up burying themselves as well.",627
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"Much as I admire Costner, it is the very qualities of honesty, honor and sincerity he projects so forcefully that encumber this Robin.",627
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,It's a slick and sassy attempt to get mileage from a dependable vehicle by wrapping it in as many sure-fire gimmicks as the filmmakers can cram onto the screen.,627
Sleepers,"Levinson knows how to make a movie. He keeps it compelling throughout, and although it runs 2 1/2 hours, Sleepers offers no room for catnaps.",628
Sleepers,"It plays out as a stylish and lurid amoral vigilante thriller, one that never earns the viewer's confidence that this is the real thing.",628
Sleepers,Views the gray tones of good and evil and what lengths people are willing to go through to re-claim the dignity they lost as children.,628
Sleepers,"...it's more than a bit disconcerting to see how the narrative makes serious wrongdoers sympathetic. Therefore, a qualified success.",628
Sleepers,"Despite it all, just try to take your eyes off this movie: skillfully crafted by Levinson, Sleepers is eminently watchable, deeply emotional, and populated with top acting talent. [Blu-ray]",628
Sleepers,Powerful story of child abuse. Not for kids.,628
Sleepers,"The problems start with Levinson's script, which overemploys Patric's florid narration to tell you what you're about to see, what it means and how you should feel about it.",628
Sleepers,"Boasting a glorious multi-generational cast (De Niro, Hoffman, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric), Levinson's tale of sexual abuse and revenge is just decent, lacking dramatic energy and relying too much on voice-over narration and conventional courtroom procedures",628
Sleepers,"It is all legally preposterous. But Levinson is a slick craftsman, his actors are insinuatingly real, and cinematographer Michael Ballhaus casts a disarmingly believable light on these proceedings.",628
Sleepers,"Disturbing, but compelling and provocative.",628
Victor/Victoria,"It was a sensational, engaging, and evocative film that rightly remains one of the bright spots of 1982 and of historical pro-LGBTQ cinema.",629
Victor/Victoria,"It’s enjoyable and basically its heart is in the right place. It’s a step forward in a time when most films seem to be a step behind, and that’s saying something.",629
Victor/Victoria,"Andrews is delightful, even as the gimmick of a plot approaches its inevitable, calamitous yet contrived, and irresolute final revelation.",629
Victor/Victoria,The art deco atmosphere seduces me with the musical numbers and a staging that exudes charm with its elaborate authenticity. [Full review in Spanish],629
Victor/Victoria,"Victor and Victoria is charming as a musical comedy, but it is also a remarkably poignant commentary on the performance",629
Victor/Victoria,"Victor Victoria is offbeat for sure -- but it is also infectiously effervescent, a well-crafted film revealing a light heart and a light touch.",629
Victor/Victoria,An intelligent film made with feeling and a profound knowledge of the comedy genre. [Full Review in Spanish],629
Victor/Victoria,It is a first-rate comedy and theatrical production.,629
Victor/Victoria,"Victor Victoria is a marvelous mixture of genders, a blatant attack on sexual attitudes that is both challenging and hilarious.",629
Victor/Victoria,"Deprived of legitimate titillation, Victor/Victoria"" comes off as another leaden Hollywood farce.",629
"Crying Game, The",The Crying Game could well be called the Best of Neil Jordan since the Irish director has gathered together everything that's worked in his more successful films.,631
"Crying Game, The","Here is a film that takes viewers on an unpredictable journey, tackling an ambitious variety of themes and ideas without ever losing the plot.",631
"Crying Game, The","Irish director Neil Jordan's compelling new film is both a political thriller and a love story, uniting various sexual and political currents into one dreamlike narrative.",631
"Crying Game, The","It’s hard to imagine a film in which the attitudes of today have changed how it plays, compared to the time when it came out (30th anniversary)",631
"Crying Game, The","Finding oneself in the midst of chaos forms the perfect metaphor in The Crying Game, a film that explores race, identity, sexuality, and perception during a tumultuous time in Ireland.",631
"Crying Game, The","More than anything, however, the film rests on the shoulders of Rea, who gives great dignity and humanity to perhaps the most passive film protagonist in recent memory.",631
"Crying Game, The","As LGBTQ lovers of the movies, its important to see movies like this one, flaws and all, for that very reason. Watch it, and let the debate rage on.",631
"Crying Game, The","The Crying Game searches for its characters' natures with a yearning that at once unveils yet retains mystery, not only in terms of sexual and political identity, but in the capacity for understanding and compassion.",631
"Crying Game, The","This movie is basically equivalent to the Paul McCartney and Wings song ""Band on the Run"" in that there are three change-ups, it keeps you guessing, and you never know quite where the movie is going land.",631
"Crying Game, The","With 20 years' perspective, it really does seem an irretrievably ropey and dated melodrama, hamstrung by any number of strange elements.",631
Sophie's Choice,"Meryl Streep's performance is brilliant but too often back-benched by writer-director Alan J. Pakula's pokey, misguided adaptation of William Styron’s novel.",632
Sophie's Choice,An infuriatingly bad movie.,632
Sophie's Choice,It's both crushing and triumphant.,632
Sophie's Choice,"For all the significance of the revelations about Sophie's past, it is the interaction between the three central characters that gives the story its strength.",632
Sophie's Choice,"The film is tentative when the story demands voice. Sophie's Choice, no matter how disturbing, remains muted.",632
Sophie's Choice,"Streep and Kline, embodying their characters in a way that goes beyond performing, obliterate the excesses on their straight and stirring journey to the heart.",632
Sophie's Choice,The amazing intimacy Pakula creates with the audience ultimately makes Sophie's Choice the best film of the year.,632
Sophie's Choice,"Whatever the film's weaknesses are, it is, albeit unsurprisingly, saved by Streep.",632
Sophie's Choice,"I found myself more intrigued by the actress than moved by the character, fascinated by Meryl's ""choices"" rather than Sophie's Choice.",632
Sophie's Choice,"...a cynical, too-slick-for-its-own-good bit of blatant awards-season filmmaking.",632
Microcosmos: Le peuple de l'herbe,The capture and camerawork is so perfect you feel like a Lilliputian observer in a Jurassic Park of sorts.,634
Microcosmos: Le peuple de l'herbe,"The movie is rated G, and it's very much recommended to children who are fascinated with all things squirmy.",634
Microcosmos: Le peuple de l'herbe,Breathtaking docu zooms in on insect life in vivid color.,634
Microcosmos: Le peuple de l'herbe,...inverts our understanding of the cosmos.,634
Microcosmos: Le peuple de l'herbe,"Both informative and entertaining, French docu doesn't presume any previous knowledge of or interest in the subject, finding the right tone (serio and also slyly humorous) to introduce in detail a previously unrecorded but fascinating universe.",634
Microcosmos: Le peuple de l'herbe,Should give the viewer a buzz.,634
Microcosmos: Le peuple de l'herbe,This is art.,634
Microcosmos: Le peuple de l'herbe,"...here's a film with drama, violence, sex and laughs; in other words, everything Hollywood has, but without the star salaries.",634
Microcosmos: Le peuple de l'herbe,fascinating and gorgeous,634
Microcosmos: Le peuple de l'herbe,"Ao revelar o microscpico universo que nos cerca, este maravilhoso documentrio faz com que, paradoxalmente, o espectador se sinta pequeno.",634
"Fog, The",The Fog is a neat twist on the classic ghost story. Carpenter achieves a palpable sense of dread and atmosphere and his score remains a signature piece of the experience he sets out to provide. The characters are unfortunately the weakest element here.,635
"Fog, The",The Fog sets out to be nothing more than a straight-forward chiller with the emphasis on the shocks rather than the characters or the story and on that level succeeds perfectly.,635
"Fog, The","Carpenter, a rather minimalist, formally restrained filmmaker even when employing the grand guignol excesses of The Thing, knows when to let pure story do the work, and The Fog is a story about stories.",635
"Fog, The","It's unpretentious genre fun, stylishly assembled and populated with colorful characters.",635
"Fog, The",...a sporadically arresting yet lamentably uninvolving horror effort from Carpenter.,635
"Fog, The","It's like sitting around a campfire, and a cold hand drops on your shoulder from out of nowhere.",635
"Fog, The","Unlike Halloween, which was a model of straight-forward terror and carefully controlled suspense, The Fog is constructed of random diversions.",635
"Fog, The","The Fog has so many things right about it in the early going that when it comes apart, the whole thing seems that much worse.",635
"Fog, The","Carpenter also relies heavily on cheap scare tactics (supernatural mists and people jumping out of the dark) rather than subtle suspense, but some sequences do turn the tension dial up quite high.",635
"Fog, The",A doozy of a chiller -- an intricate tale of intrigue and terror stirred by a century-old shipwreck.,635
Escape from New York,"Despite a marvellous night-time opening sequence, this slice of escapism never really delivers on the ingenuity of its premise.",636
Escape from New York,"Not my favorite classic Carpenter film, it still offers a scrappy look into the director’s political edge.",636
Escape from New York,The filmmaker’s cynical sense of humor and anti-authoritarian stance are all over the movie without overwhelming the suspense/entertainment focus.,636
Escape from New York,"From Kurt Russell immortalizing the lead character to the comic books, action figures, and board games that followed, “Escape from New York” still excites its fans and has earned its status as a time-tested cult classic.",636
Escape from New York,Escape From New York is an iconic action thriller of the 80's that is arguably Carpenter's coolest film. Snake Plissken is a unique antihero played perfectly by Russell as he demolishes his Disney stigma. It's a good time that remains scarily relevant.,636
Escape from New York,Sixty per cent a perfectly realized film.,636
Escape from New York,"New York as surreal, existential hell was done much better by Walter Hill in The Warriors; Carpenter’s imagery fails to shock today’s jaded audiences.",636
Escape from New York,One of John Carpenter's most popular films remains this futuristic yarn featuring an irresistible hook and an iconic anti-hero.,636
Escape from New York,"Regardless of how much John Carpenter pays homage to Howard Hawks, or how much Kurt Russell's performance is rooted in Clint Eastwood's various onscreen characters, Escape from New York stands on its own merits and achieves something unique.",636
Escape from New York,"What works is the tone, the character, and the deeply cynical attitude towards authority of all stripes.",636
"Howling, The","Well performed, with convincing effects for its time, The Howling isn’t the best werewolf feature, but it’s required viewing for any fan.",637
"Howling, The",Rob Bottin's Howling man-to-werewolf sequence is like nothing you've ever seen before. It's amazing!,637
"Howling, The",...still shocks and amuses in equal parts...,637
"Howling, The",A clever story that deals with cults and media coverage.,637
"Howling, The",[Dante] has demonstrated a deft touch at mixing genuinely horrifying effects and sly humour in The Howling.,637
"Howling, The","humorous and self-aware as it often is, The Howling fundamentally works as a scary-gory werewolf thriller, with Bottin's transformation effects casting a nearly hypnotic spell",637
"Howling, The","The Howling is a fantastic off-beat horror flick with a dash of comedy that still holds up great 40 years later. The effects are fantastic, the script, acting and directing are superb and it's just an all-around fun movie.",637
"Howling, The","The atmosphere is too bright and insincere, with a focus on creating dread through untrustworthy accomplices rather than terrifying bloodshed.",637
"Howling, The",The monster movie is back!,637
"Howling, The","Dante manages to overcome his limitations to some degree, but the film itself never quite leaves the middle of the road.",637
"Return of Martin Guerre, The","Although the answer to the is-he-or-isn't-he question is never really in doubt, this is nonetheless a fascinating film.",638
"Return of Martin Guerre, The",It's so superbly acted and it's kind of about acting.,638
"Return of Martin Guerre, The","[A] sad, exquisite film.",638
"Return of Martin Guerre, The",A sobering account not only Medieval provincial life but the extremely limited role of women's agency.,638
"Return of Martin Guerre, The","The restoration is vivid, rendering the film even more striking than it was in 1982. The narrative still puts on on the edge of ones seat. Depardieu and Baye at their best.",638
"Return of Martin Guerre, The","It's fitting that there are so many good performances here since, in the subtext, The Return of Martin Guerre is a film about acting.",638
"Return of Martin Guerre, The","It's not about whether a man is guilty or innocent, but whether reality is worth holding onto.",638
"Return of Martin Guerre, The","Compelling romantic mystery drama, well acted by Gerard Depardieu and Natalie Baye; stay away from the American remake, Sommersby",638
"Return of Martin Guerre, The","A brilliant, engaging love story with magnificent performances",638
"Return of Martin Guerre, The","Fascinating tale; inspiration for ""Sommersby""",638
"Tin Drum, The",The film is done with such grace and control that we quickly accept the singular perspective of this bizarre tale.,639
"Tin Drum, The",Marches to the beat of its own drum.,639
"Tin Drum, The","Schlondorff treads the thin line between fantasy and nightmare... always rewarding his audience with precious bits of humor, horror, and pathos.",639
"Tin Drum, The","The best parts of The Tin Drum are its powerful and forceful images, the primitivism of the narrative, its overwhelming and justified beauty, and its child actor David Bennent. [Full Review in Spanish]",639
"Tin Drum, The","The Tin Drum is, in fact, almost everything anybody could ask a film to be. It is strikingly original and continuously surprising.",639
"Tin Drum, The","Walks a taut, high rope between doubles and split selves, docu-realism and surrealism, brutality and navet, sacred and profane, and history and myth, without falling into the safety net of childish fantasy. (It only falters in its final half-hour.)",639
"Tin Drum, The","If ever [the characters in] a film embodied Hannah Arendt's principle of ""the banality of evil"", it's The Tin Drum...",639
"Tin Drum, The","There are many themes running through The Tin Drum: resistance against an unkind world, the need for acceptance, the horrors of romance and war, and the final idea that growth is inevitable and unfortunately, necessary.",639
"Tin Drum, The","In Volker Schlndorff's restored version of his 1979 classic, Oskar Matzerath emerges as a tragic anti-hero, whose lustful imagination and prodigious magical gifts can't shield him from the juggernaut of war.",639
"Tin Drum, The",Schlndorff has a tendency to sketch the rest of the cast as simple grotesques or symbols of decadence that are unconvincingly humanized in the final third.,639
"Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover, The",A film that pairs the most profane language with the most exquisite production. [Full review in Spanish],640
"Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover, The","If you’ve never seen the movie or haven’t for years, you will come away from it with an even deeper-seated respect for Mirren, who does her damnedest in a largely unwritten role.",640
"Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover, The",A highly controversial and distinctly original work of cinematic art fashioned by writer-director Greenaway.,640

"Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover, The",Greenaway's new film is -- let us waste no time -- a masterpiece.,640
"Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover, The","The film doesn't even justify itself on intellectual grounds. It is pointless self-indulgence, more likely to bore sophisticated audiences than shock or titillate them.",640
"Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover, The","Greenaway -- inspired by Jacobean revenge plays and Dutch masters' paintings -- stuffs the viewer with ripe images and raw language. He tests your appetite for intelligent sensation. For many it may be a daunting test, but it is worth taking.",640
"Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover, The","This is a shocking, confrontational film that is intended to disturb. It is also an adult film in the best sense.",640
"Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover, The","Gambon is stupendous, a roaring hound from hell. And Mirren is his match in a performance of mounting fervor.",640
"Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover, The","Greenaway is never able to establish a real sense of evil and dread. No matter how monstrous their actions, his characters remain cartoons, which of course renders their actions much less disturbing, much more easily dismissed.",640
Paths of Glory,"Paths of Glory was too sobering to be a popular success, but it established Kubrick as a leading director.",641
Paths of Glory,The director Stanley Kubrick and the producer-star Kirk Douglas anticipated the countercultural energy of the 1960s with this angry anti-war parable.,641
Paths of Glory,"...the real enemy here is the French officer class who, from their opulently appointed chateau, use infantry as pawns in pursuit of personal promotion and in covering up of their own highly consequential failures.",641
Paths of Glory,"Arguably the greatest antiwar film ever made, Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory feels like a mule kick to the stomach no matter how many times one has seen it (in my case, too many to recall).",641
Paths of Glory,The film also excels thanks to Kubrick’s visual choices particularly his decision to shoot in black and white. It is perfect considering the harshness of the material and the morally murky waters we navigate through.,641
Paths of Glory,"Language issues notwithstanding, Stanley Kubrick certainly knows what he's doing with Paths of Glory.",641
Paths of Glory,"Mr. Kubrick has not been able to inject into figures which are literary and alien from the rough vitality which so naturally flowed [in The Killing]. Nevertheless, Paths of Glory in its authority, its piercingness, is an extraordinary film.",641
Paths of Glory,I can't even begin to imagine how Kubrick made this movie. I was perplexed the entire time. An absolute masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish],641
Paths of Glory,The directors most humanist film.,641
Paths of Glory,"At any time, fashionable or not, it is a disturbing plea against the horror and senselessness of war.",641
"Grifters, The","Toying with L.A. film noir, the director, Stephen Frears, and the scriptwriter, Donald E. Westlake, do twisted, anomalous things.",642
"Grifters, The",Wonderfully eccentric.,642
"Grifters, The","Frears has taken many liberties with the book, and the movie is, something rather rare, better than the original. [Full review in Spanish]",642
"Grifters, The",Frears is as good with the small touches as he is with the big ones -- and that means they're great.,642
"Grifters, The",There's little doubt that The Grifters ultimately fares quite a bit better than its literary predecessor...,642
"Grifters, The",A slick and stylish neo-noir crime drama featuring three exceptional performances.,642
"Grifters, The",These doomed grifters deserve instant admission into the film noir pantheon.,642
"Grifters, The","[VIDEO] Although the movie recalls films by the Coen Brothers or the Dahl Brothers, ""The Grifters"" retains its source material's voice in a thoroughly original way. Here's a neo-noir you can never see too many times.",642
"Grifters, The",A darkly cynical and uncompromising gem.,642
"Grifters, The",Best to savor The Grifters for its handsome design -- the picture looks as clean as a Hockney landscape -- and its juicy performances.,642
The Innocent,The Innocent is one of the more moving heist flicks you’re ever likely to see.,643
The Innocent,"Garrel walks a fine line between the tragic thriller and the hopeful family comedy, bridging the two with a dry, typically French sense of humour.",643
The Innocent,The movie's evolution is surprisingly explosive considering how intimate it seems. [Full review in Spanish],643
The Innocent,Both a terrific black comedy and tension-filled crime caper...,643
The Innocent,"While its unpredictability delivers sporadic laughs, The Innocent’s strongest weapon is its unexpected heart, which is reinforced by its solid performances.",643
The Innocent,"Actor-filmmaker Louis Garrel inventively packs the screen with chatty characters, slapstick silliness and tense action, and he also pulls a range of story strands in often surprising directions. So watching it feels like taking a rather wild ride.",643
The Innocent,"The film (which Garrel directs as well as stars in) gathers a madcap momentum, in the way that really bad life choices are apt to do.",643
The Innocent,This film has enchanting performances and greater depths and fewer cliches than it could easily have slipped into.,643
The Innocent,... A frothy heist movie with an unexpectedly tender heart.,643
The Innocent,"Overall, this is a comic drama, and one way to sum it up would be that it's not funny enough to be a great comedy and not coherent enough to be a strong drama. Still, it has freshness and all sorts of odd little surprises.",643
"Thin Blue Line, The",The film pioneered reenactments and demonstrated the use of true crime documentaries to point out and correct issues in the criminal justice system.,644
"Thin Blue Line, The","Noted as the investigative documentary that actually got a wrongly convicted man off of death row, Blue Line also inaugurated Morris’ extreme-slo-mo and exploratory lyricism modes.",644
"Thin Blue Line, The","A film that provides an exhilarating study into the subjectivity of its interviewees, and by proxy, or perhaps more intentionally so, the subjectivity of documentaries.",644
"Thin Blue Line, The","Documentaries have changed minds, championed causes, and even reversed policy, but The Thin Blue Line (1988) may be the first film to free a man from prison.",644
"Thin Blue Line, The",...engaging as a procedural and compelling as a meditation on the nature of truth.,644
"Thin Blue Line, The","Morris was working in a dangerous middle ground between the traditional documentary and the fictional feature film, and his merging of various techniques paid off in a film of singular uniqueness in both its aesthetic approach and its real-world impact.",644
"Thin Blue Line, The",The Thin Blue Line is one of the films that helped make documentaries a viable entertainment option for arthouse moviegoers during the indie-film boom of the 1980s and '90s.,644
"Thin Blue Line, The","The Thin Blue Line is proof that sometimes, though rarely, the political impact of a film can be as tangible as an innocent man being freed from prison.",644
"Thin Blue Line, The","Arguably no other film of the 1980s, fiction or non-fiction, was as significant in blurring the boundaries between what's reel and real and in demonstrating the remarkable impact a movie could have.",644
"Thin Blue Line, The",Errol Morris' breakout documentary is immaculate.,644
Paris Is Burning,This beautiful film is about surviving on the fringe—and looking amazing while doing it.,645
Paris Is Burning,Makes smashing use of the documentary form: it shares with the audience its knowledge of a glittering American subculture... that is little known to most of us.,645
Paris Is Burning,It’s a documentary that demands to be seen.,645
Paris Is Burning,"Jennie Livingston’s time capsule look of LGBT balls is an acknowledged classic, inclusively incisive in its portrait of a NYC diaspora of a marginalized community...",645
Paris Is Burning,...it is most importantly a story about the power of chosen family — the solace that can come simply by finding other people in the world that can relate to your struggles and will love you regardless.,645
Paris Is Burning,"In this gritty but celebratory documentary produced and directed by Lesbian filmmaker Jennie Livingston, it is not the fashions but the characters that stay with the viewer.",645
Paris Is Burning,"It is strong, sardonically funny, sometimes shattering stuff.",645
Paris Is Burning,"Jennie Livingston's seminal documentary film shines a spotlight on New York City's ball culture, a place where African-American and Latino LGBTQ people could live out their high-glamour fantasies.",645
Paris Is Burning,Paris is Burning is still an important film 30 years after its release - a snapshot of a specific time and place that humanizes its subjects and allows those of us in a place of privilege to understand them better.,645
Paris Is Burning,A scintillating example of how art can serve life without compromising its objective of adding meaning to our journey.,645
Once Upon a Time in the West,"Sergio Leone’s 1968 spaghetti western might be set in the 19th century, but it captured the violence of the ’60s, yet the grandly cinematic film that still somehow embraces humanity.",646
Once Upon a Time in the West,"The epic spaghetti Western features an excellent score from Ennio Morricone, sweeping cinematography, and a gritty cast with rugged features that are great for Leone’s close-up and long takes.",646
Once Upon a Time in the West,Leone’s gloriously inflated epic isn’t just any old Western. It’s all of them.,646
Once Upon a Time in the West,"It is rare to find a Western that is so immersive, even when the characters aren’t as complex as they could be.",646
Once Upon a Time in the West,"Self-aware in every respect, from his dynamic framing to the prolonged showdowns, Leone's meticulous style may distance some viewers from making an emotional connection to his work, but striking dramatic chords is hardly his principal intention.",646
Once Upon a Time in the West,"The costumes were great as well. Jill McBain stands out from the crowd as a ""city"" girl when she first arrives - many of her dresses are elegant and beautiful - whereas someone like Cheyenne is always dusty and looks dirty and hot.",646
Once Upon a Time in the West,"Although the cast is impressive, with a significant part for a leading lady (something absent from Leone's other ventures), it's the primary antagonist who is most amusing.",646
Once Upon a Time in the West,I wish my words could convey just how wonderful this film is. But they can't. Sergio Leone was a poet with a camera.,646
Once Upon a Time in the West,"Leone's newest effort, Once Upon a Time in the West, with a major cast and a lot of big studio money behind it, proves that he is simply a serious bore.",646
Once Upon a Time in the West,"If there had to be a final Western, Once Upon a Time in the West would be it.",646
Ran,"Rereleased by StudioCanal to celebrate Shakespeare’s 400th anniversary, his breathtaking adaptation of King Lear proves, so far at least, to be as immune to the effects of time as the original",647
Ran,"“Ran” stands as a cross-cultural testament to timeless storytelling, where Kurosawa's indomitable spirit shapes a profound meditation on power, chaos, and the enduring resonance of Shakespearean influence.",647
Ran,"Kurosawa is not merely true to Shakespeare’s story, he brings scenes alive with a cultural twist and a visual mastery...",647
Ran,"Ran makes miraculous use of color, and has a feel to it that only Kurosawa could accomplish.",647
Ran,"Over-long, dull in the middle, and unnecessarily tragic...",647
Ran,Just in time for its 30th anniversary - and the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death - comes a beautiful 4K restoration...,647
Ran,An arresting amalgamation of unforgettable imagery.,647
Ran,One can hardly watch Ran without feeling a sense of prophecy fulfilled. The tragic results displayed in this film suggest we all need to discern more deeply exactly who we can trust to lead us.,647
Ran,Ran takes film spectacle to new heights. Kurosawa continues not only to extend his own powers but to exploit new technical advances.,647
Ran,There is not a wasted second. [Here] is proof of what we seldom doubted: Kurosawa is a director who becomes godlike rather than gaga in old age.,647
"Quiet Man, The","Since Ford’s father was born in Co Galway and his mother on the island of Inishmore, and since this is such an enjoyable piece of nonsense, he gets a pass for this depiction of the country as a nation of loveable, blarney-spouting, brawling drunks.",648
"Quiet Man, The",No other John Ford movie provides me with as much pure pleasure -- and leaves a perpetual grin on my mug -- as the Irish-American director’s ode to his family’s ancestral country.,648
"Quiet Man, The",Ford early on captures the film's more dramatic moments before giving way to its lightly romantic humor.,648
"Quiet Man, The",A lovely film. A bucolic romance with a western soul. [Full review in Spanish],648
"Quiet Man, The","It may not be a Western, but it's one of director John Ford's finest collaborations with John Wayne.",648
"Quiet Man, The","The Quiet Man is John Ford's best picture since The Informer, but much, much funnier.",648
"Quiet Man, The",Incredible chemistry and one of the most epic kisses in all of movies make it a fun watch for me,648
"Quiet Man, The","Credit must go to O'Hara, who is at her most magnetic in this film, and is central to what makes ""The Quiet Man"" so enjoyable and so memorable.",648
"Quiet Man, The",As much an anthropological adventure as a romantic rhapsody.,648
"Quiet Man, The","The film's saucy mix of comedy and melodrama is one of its greatest charms, although it can give you whiplash from time to time, especially if you're not used to Ford's brand of broad, back-slapping comedy",648
Once Upon a Time in America,"A bad movie at any length, swimming in the syrup of Morricone's score. But hey, some call it a masterpiece.",649
Once Upon a Time in America,"It isn’t just the echoing moments that keep you absorbed. It’s those reverberant dreamland settings and Leone’s majestic, billowing sense of film movement; the images seem to come at you in waves of feeling.",649
Once Upon a Time in America,Once Upon a Time in America is a tremendous work that captures the animating ambition and sorrow at the heart of the American Dream.,649
Once Upon a Time in America,...sprawling subject matter that's employed to admittedly erratic yet often striking effect by Leone...,649
Once Upon a Time in America,...an epic of blinkered nostalgia.,649
Once Upon a Time in America,"The cinematographic style has evolved, but it's still unmistakably reminiscent of his earlier projects.",649
Once Upon a Time in America,"A stratosphere-scraping citadel of cinema, nearly everything about Leone's last film - and greatest masterwork - speaks to the grand illusion of the American Dream.",649
Once Upon a Time in America,"The movie's four hours long, but no one had the time to write a single real character.",649
Once Upon a Time in America,"Complex gangster epic has strong violence, sex.",649
Once Upon a Time in America,"This would-be epic schlep, dragging almost 50 years of chronology over a sluggish 140 minutes, is far too slight of text and ponderous of presentation to sustain more than nodding-off dramatic interest.",649
"Seventh Seal, The","It’s a masterpiece of filmmaking from a master of the profession, and remains an impactful viewing experience even if you can’t tell a knight from a rook.",650
"Seventh Seal, The","Like many of his greatest works, Bergman uses The Seventh Seal as an existentialist vehicle, exploring a landscape where God may have turned his back on humanity, leading to disillusionment, conflict and destruction.",650
"Seventh Seal, The","A formidable film in which Bergman, with symbols and metaphors, builds a philosophical treatise that points out the impossibility of man to defeat death. [Full review in Spanish]",650
"Seventh Seal, The","Arguably the most famous of Ingmar Bergman’s films and certainly his most iconic, 'The Seventh Seal' is Bergman at his most allegorical.",650

"Seventh Seal, The","As a youth, perhaps no other film opened my eyes to the wonderful possibilities of cinema as much as The Seventh Seal.",650
"Seventh Seal, The",A parable that’s never staid or stuffy.,650
"Seventh Seal, The",Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal stands as one of the writer/director's greatest triumphs thanks to its exploration of intriguing themes that are woven into a tapestry of fascinating & compelling characters,650
"Seventh Seal, The",Mr. Bergman’s objective in The Seventh Seal has been to achieve with the camera the simplicity and directness of a medieval muralist in recounting an immemorial mystery drama which touches the great issues of human experience.,650
"Seventh Seal, The","The magnificent craftsmanship, of course, I admit. But beneath the surface of the high-class, bony morality which has understandably attracted so much admiration there lurks what to me is a dreadful squashy sentimentality.",650
Glory,"A rousing Civil War drama based on the true story of the 54th Massachusetts infantry, a Union regiment of black soldiers.",651
Glory,"Director Edward Zwick stages some remarkable battle sequences, but the film’s core rests in the complicated relationships between its characters.",651
Glory,"Even though Glory still isn't a completely accurate depiction of Shaw or his troops during the Civil War, it has some great scenes and shots throughout.",651
Glory,"Especially fine are Andre Braugher, Morgan Freeman, Jihmi Kennedy, Denzel Washington and Cary Elwes.",651
Glory,[It] showed Black soldiers are worthy in the battle to fight for their own freedom and protect the Union.,651
Glory,Glory reaches its indisputable moment of glory. [Full review in Spanish],651
Glory,A moving piece of historical drama and an evocative human story of men whose fight wasn’t strictly reserved for the battlefield.,651
Glory,"Washington, in his best performance since the black-story-white-viewpoint misfire of Cry Freedom, is exceptionally good as a fugitive slave whose tense relationship with Matthew Broderick charges the film's emotional core.",651
Glory,"Glory leaves you with not just the sense of its characters’ triumph over injustice, but their destruction by the very system that empowered them to begin with. There’s no escaping that story, either -- even if Glory doesn’t really tell it.",651
Glory,This is the rare Hollywood blockbuster that has the gumption to tell us there really is no justice.,651
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,"If you are familiar with ""Hamlet"" and can appreciate subtle jokes about the possibility that your entire life is pointless, this movie is a hoot.",652
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,"Fans of the original stage play will most likely enjoy Stoppard's film version, but this treatment feels far less dynamic or lively.",652

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,Both Oldman and Roth turn in flat and uninspiring performances.,652
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,Really head-twisting adaptation of the play with fine work from Oldman and Roth.,652
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,Probably the best stage to screen adaptation I've ever seen. Essential.,652
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,Tom Stoppard's 1967 morality play has been translated into a high-spirited and well-acted film.,652
Touch of Evil,"It's a full toybox, or candy box, fattening and immensely pleasurable.",653
Touch of Evil,The film noir genre's visual style has Touch of Evil to thank for its contributions in sound and cinematography as Orson Welles and Russell Metty are a match made in heaven.,653
Touch of Evil,“Touch of Evil” is a movie filled with craft and vision.,653
Touch of Evil,"But as masterful as Welles’s filming is, what makes Touch of Evil a staggering masterpiece is the global quality of his style...",653

Touch of Evil,"Classic film noirs epitome and epitaph, Orson Welless Touch of Evil gets a stunning new UHD upgrade from Kino Lorber.",653
Touch of Evil,"This dazzling achievement has the rare good fortune of being one of those films that somehow seems to improve with each subsequent viewing -- the highest compliment indeed, given that it only takes one showing to evaluate its substantial worth.",653
Touch of Evil,"[The] ticking of the time bomb, which guides us into the parallel rhythm of a mambo in the nondescript little Mexican border town on the night the story opens, is pure cinema, utilizing image and sound marvelously to establish an immediate effect.",653
Touch of Evil,Touch of Evil remains a masterpiece in its repaired state.,653
Touch of Evil,"Touch of Evil is about racism and American chauvinism, and the haves and have-nots.",653
Chinatown,"Chinatown hits 50 this year and this Jack Nicholson film noir has lost none of its potency. Featuring the legendary John Huston alongside Faye Dunaway, this Oscar winning story from Robert Towne is still essential viewing.",654
Chinatown,"Among its myriad alluring – and lurid – contradictions, Chinatown is overtly stylish yet understated, depicting inveterate moral decay and corruption so matter-of-factly that Huston’s emphatic refusal to accept any blame... makes your skin crawl.",654
Chinatown,The result was acrimony behind the scenes and genius on the screen in a masterpiece that repays any number of viewings.,654
Chinatown,One of the greatest movies of the 20th century was Roman Polanski’s 1974 film noir with the darkest twist imaginable (50th anniversary),654
Chinatown,The cast of Chinatown is well chosen and Nicholson has the right amount of “swagger” and confidence to pull off the cocky private eye.,654
Chinatown,"In its total recapturing of a past, in its plot, its vivid characterizations, its carefully calculated and accelerating pace, its whole demonstration of a medium mastered, Chinatown reminds you again that motion pictures are larger, not smaller than life.",654
Chinatown,"The miracle of the picture is that the tale itself, composed of so many familiar elements -- and I mean 30-years-of-moviegoing familiar -- is grippingly convincing throughout. It is like going to your first movies all over again.",654
Chinatown,"The film, set in the thirties, from a script by Robert Towne, is wickedly skillful, funny, and socially alert.",654
Chinatown,You are slowly drawn deep into the director's trap before he springs his surprises. It's a bit like strolling through a beautiful field of flowers and suddenly being told not to move another step because you are in the middle of a minefield.,654
Chinatown,"It is so big and so thrilling and so entertaining that years from now, when we look back on the really important films of the 1970s, Chinatown is likely to be one of the most fondly remembered.",654
Stand by Me,A fine dramatic departure for a director who made his reputation in comedy.,655
Stand by Me,"Stand By Me is a ""coming of age"" tale with moments of vulnerability that make it somewhat relatable while still keeping it unusual.",655
Stand by Me,"It’s difficult to watch this film exactly as it is without reminiscing even a little bit about one’s own life as an adult, which I think speaks to Reiner’s approach in adapting the work.",655
Stand by Me,"Rob Reiner (directing his first drama) captures the texture of adolescent friendship and draws superb, vital performances from his young cast.",655
Stand by Me,"[The boys] petty bickering and self-revelations unfold convincingly and with great humour, bottling that uncertain moment in life between childhood and adolescence.",655
Stand by Me,Rob Reiner should’ve gotten at least like one cool mention in a Beastie Boys song for his hot streak.,655
Stand by Me,"""Stand by Me"" stirs memories, especially if you've been a boy, especially if (like me), you were a '50s kid whose old pals have grown up and drifted apart.",655
Stand by Me,"The line, ""I never really had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve,"" is a haunting fact and true wellspring of great sadness for most men. ""Stand By Me"" is one of the most memorable, funny, and wise movies ever made about boyhood.",655
Stand by Me,"It's an autumnal movie and a self-indulgent one, carried by the inherent pathos of its premise...",655
Stand by Me,It's among the light sprinkling of King tales that elide the supernatural entirely. But that doesn't mean it isn't morbid...,655
"Manchurian Candidate, The",And yet the film as a whole fails to move deeply. One questions whether it will have a profound impact on its viewers.,657
"Manchurian Candidate, The","Demme's 2004 remake, which moved the action into the present day and cast Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber and Meryl Streep in the key roles...tweaked the ending just enough to make things feel even more hopeless.",657
"Manchurian Candidate, The",Disappointing remake of the classic 1962 thriller.,657

"Manchurian Candidate, The","Good as the players are, they can't make this hokum remotely believable.",657
"Manchurian Candidate, The","If it isn't the original's equal, The Manchurian Candidate conjures up an air of menace sufficient to make most modern thrillers look like romantic comedies.",657
"Manchurian Candidate, The",Sleek remake is more violent than original.,657
"Manchurian Candidate, The","This humorless and nonsensical update of The Manchurian Candidate - a total misread of Frankenheimer's classic original - never quite engages, devolving the original's camp and satire into self-serious melodrama.",657
"Manchurian Candidate, The",Jonathan Demme's new Manchurian Candidate is a gourmet-popcorn movie--a hugely entertaining thriller shot through with dark shards of agony and paranoia. It takes nothing away from the original while delivering pleasures all its own.,657
Pump Up the Volume,The film could have been much better...or not because its intrinsic falsehood condemns it from the start. [Full review in Spanish],658
Pump Up the Volume,While watching Pump Up the Volume I was amazed that such an anti-establishment movie was produced by 1990’s mainstream Hollywood.,658
Pump Up the Volume,"The fact that it does this simply and unabashedly gives the critic little to work with; it's all there, right on the surface, with nothing to decode–just a dream, and a dream of an idea, that it asks us to share and celebrate. And better yet, emulate.",658
Pump Up the Volume,Allan Moyle's angsty coming-of-age romp...,658
Pump Up the Volume,"If you don't mind (or even like) the standard teen fare that is the stuff such movies are made of, there are a couple of good reasons to see this one.",658
Pump Up the Volume,"Call it Rebel With a Cause, and listen good, because it's the most frank, startling and radically opinionated movie ever made for young viewers.",658
Pump Up the Volume,'Pump Up The Volume' Still Shines In Its Exploration of Depression and Trauma,658
Pump Up the Volume,"As a movie, 'Pump Up the Volume' is a lot like a teenager: at times unbearably self-important and pretentious (Nora's poems, good lord), yet undeniably, and admirably, earnest.",658
Pump Up the Volume,"Sharply uneven, this teen-angst feature begins exgremely well with some relevant social commentary; it also put on the map Christian Slater as a talent to watch.",658
Pump Up the Volume,"Slater is Moyle's generator, powering the film through some sludgy melodramatics, and while his separation of Mark and Hard Harry is practically Kabuki theater, the effort is just wonderful.",658
Arsenic and Old Lace,"Director Frank Capra, one of Hollywood’s great filmmakers and a man whose films appreciated the serious troubles society can inflict on people, clearly wanted to make a no-holds-barred comedy that thrives on lunacy. He succeeded.",659
Arsenic and Old Lace,It is full of wicked humor that keeps the macabre tone throughout the movie and was yet another notch on Frank Capra’s belt of hit comedies.,659
Arsenic and Old Lace,"One of the film’s rewards is that, upon rewatching and rethinking, there’s all that subconscious evidence buried in the story’s basement, and much of the audience’s satisfaction rests in the desire to keep it concealed.",659
Arsenic and Old Lace,It's not mere hyperbole to state that Frank Capra's Arsenic and Old Lace ranks as one of the funniest films ever made.,659
Arsenic and Old Lace,Arsenic and Old Lace trenchantly lays bare the hypocrisies and prejudices of the upper-middle class that often remained concealed beneath the façade of good manners.,659
Arsenic and Old Lace,"Although at first glance it seems a horrific issue, it is truthfully laughable to the extreme and no one is taking it seriously. [Full review in Spanish]",659
Arsenic and Old Lace,"A zany, cant-catch-your-breath comedy that never quits.",659
Arsenic and Old Lace,"Regardless of Cary Grant's thoughts on the film, Arsenic and Old Lace is one of the best comedies of all time.",659
Arsenic and Old Lace,"In its fast-paced, scatterbrained pandemonium, the varying characters and their intersecting stories rarely seem to fit together smoothly.",659
Arsenic and Old Lace,Grows increasingly tiresome.,659
Fried Green Tomatoes,"Fried Green Tomatoes is iconic in its presentation of love across the years, across generations and across boundaries. It’s a tamed but still powerful love story -- and a lesbian classic, if only in subtext.",660
Fried Green Tomatoes,A compelling and enjoyable movie.,660
Fried Green Tomatoes,"Do not be deterred by the indigestible title nor, if feministically inclined, by the fact that it is directed by mere man Jon Avnet. It is funny, cleverly constructed, often rather moving, and only occasionally allows sentiment to slop over the bucket.",660
Fried Green Tomatoes,"The final and most important question is, is Fried Green Tomatoes worth all the compromise or will you leave the theater forlorn and bleary eyed? Not to worry... it will leave you with that warm, gummy feeling you get when Bette Midler sings a lullabye.",660
Fried Green Tomatoes,"For all of its false touches, its confusions, its incohesiveness and perplexing shifts of tone, there's something wonderfully sweet and zesty about Fried Green Tomatoes.",660
Fried Green Tomatoes,"[A] clunky, fraudulent, yet apparently crowd-pleasing laugh-and-tear-jerker.",660
Fried Green Tomatoes,"When a group of actors this gifted and lively tries so good-naturedly to deliver such an obvious message, the audience is left in the position of trying to stop a tidal wave. You may hate yourself for responding, but you're smothered before you know it.",660
Fried Green Tomatoes,"It's a nice, pleasant celebration of friendship, but without much meat to chew on.",660
Fried Green Tomatoes,It doesn't quite have the courage to face its own implications and so leaves the story that follows in a kind of blur apt to offend no one but equally incapable of moving anyone.,660
Fried Green Tomatoes,"Fried Green Tomatoes is gosh-darned lovable, even if it does get downright sugary at times.",660
High Noon,"It’s a film with an universal and timeless story, good versus evil. It’s an straightforward film with a clearly defined hero and villain. To say that they don’t make films quite like High Noon, is an understatement.",661
High Noon,High Noon is not only one of the best Western films of all time but changed the way people viewed the Western genre.,661
High Noon,"Without question, this is one of the three best westerns since Stagecoach (the other two being The Westerner and My Darling Clementine). But my admiration for it is not without qualification.",661
High Noon,Fred Zinnemann’s film generates suspense — and stark social commentary...,661
High Noon,Not since My Darling Clementine have we seen a more exciting gun battle on the screen than that in High Noon.,661
High Noon,"Add a string of plausible characterizations and an excellent performance by Gary Cooper as a former town marshal, and High Noon moves up into the class of absorbing drama.",661
High Noon,Director Fred Zinnemann's expert hand has made High Noon one of the best film western of all time.,661
High Noon,"This gives us some time-tested staples: Gary Cooper, a pioneer Western town, lawlessness, gun-shootin' and a haunting theme song you've probably heard already. To these add a movie rarity -- a mature point of view.",661
High Noon,"High Noon is just what a Western should be -- a page out of American folklore, a close-to-the-soil delineation of human characters, played against a true-to-life background.",661
High Noon,"Its insights are primer sociology, and the demonstration of the town's cowardice is Q.E.D. It's a tight piece of work, though -- well directed by Fred Zinnemann.",661
Somewhere in Time,"Somewhere In Time, like its central character, is out of its proper time and place. It's an interesting experiment, and a brave one, but one that was doomed to fail in 1981.",662
Somewhere in Time,Somewhere in Time is murky and underwritten. The basic premise would be thin even for a Harlequin romance.,662
Somewhere in Time,"Sloppy where it should be sure, crudely drawn where it should be sensitive, careless around the edges with extraneous bits of business, the film takes the audience's complicity for granted and loses its grasp in the process.",662
Somewhere in Time,"Funny, smart, touching and, did we mention romantic? Somewhere in Time is a masterclass in acting, writing and emotive cinema. Required viewing.",662
Somewhere in Time,"I understand why this movie has a respectable cult following. I get the appeal. I only wish the movie would have followed through with its promising premise all the way. I didn't dislike it, but was a little letdown.",662
Somewhere in Time,"A charming, witty, passionate romantic drama about a love transcending space and time, Somewhere In Time is an old-fashioned film in the best sense of that term.",662
Somewhere in Time,"Jeannot Szwarc does well in the director's chair, and Jean-Pierre Dorleac (brother of Francoise) deserves special commendation for his costumes. But Seymour is given too little to do, and Reeve does too much.",662
Somewhere in Time,"Director Jeannot Szwarc strains hard for spectacular visual effects, though he's barely able to compose a competent close-up.",662
Somewhere in Time,This must go down as a missed opportunity.,662
Somewhere in Time,The movie surrounds its love story with such boring mumbo jumbo about time travel that we finally just don't care.,662
Being There,Being There is simply reminding us of how fragile our state of being actually is.,663
Being There,Peter Sellers' last great performance came in this gently satiric look at the dawning mass media culture from the book by Jerzy Kosiński.,663
Being There,Alternately lovely and lacerating.,663
Being There,"Under the direction of Hal Ashby, in his first film since Coming Home, Sellers gives an impressively disciplined performance, always taut and under control. The difficulty with the film, however, is that the screenplay is basically a one-joke story.",663
Being There,"Devoid of finger-wagging, bellicose tirades, or emotional manipulation, Being There is a scathing commentary on politics and the media that points out how patently easy is it to fool people, often with their own willful, enthusiastic participation.",663
Being There,"Among the sharpest of all satires, Being There, released in 1979, would be the last great film made by director Hal Ashby, who had the most extraordinary track record of any filmmaker of the 1970s.",663
Being There,"One of the rare cases in which a novel is translated into a film with its humor, insight, and pathos intact.",663
Being There,"The humor continues to surface, regularly generating laugh-out-loud bewilderment and crushing awkwardness.",663
Being There,"That ... Chance [is] perfectly aware of when others expect his contribution and of that contribution's general tenor, is nothing short of a high-wire act.",663
Being There,"Gently directed by Hal Ashby, this satire of a ruling class in which nobody knows anything is almost plausible, and certainly topical.",663
"Paris, Texas","Even after 40 years, Wim Wenders' Paris, Texas remains a quietly powerful, emotionally rich character study that explores its relationships and central mystery in a remarkably compelling fashion.",664
"Paris, Texas","Nothing literally detonates, but the film locks into connotations of the Big Bang it references — how sustained shouts transform densely packed atoms into an explosion that flings us farther apart than we could imagine and into a vast, strange new world.",664
"Paris, Texas","In Wim Wenders’ Paris, Texas, Travis is adrift, caught in the comma between the liminal Paris and the redemptive Texas, between lost futures and the impermeable present.",664
"Paris, Texas","The panoramic vistas from the cinematographer Robby Müller are as breathtaking as any John Ford western, while the naturalistic performances and deft narrative structure make this the strongest movie in the career of its director, Wim Wenders.",664
"Paris, Texas","It transcends [Wenders'] usual road movie archetypes and pressing alienation, and it enters the realm of an almost mythic quest for healing and reconciliation after the emotional fallout of masculine violence.",664
"Paris, Texas","Most of the performances hit every right note especially Stanton, Kinski, and young Carson. All of this is brought together under the management of Wenders who tells a living, breathing story free of contrivances and artifice.",664
"Paris, Texas","... An eerie, sad story whose meaning disappears over the vast horizon as if on a highway heading away through the desert.",664
"Paris, Texas","It's a striking, gripping film for most of its length, with Wenders and cinematographer Robby Muller showing a great love of and fascination for the land -- almost as if their European upbringings had made them slightly envious of the wide-open spaces.",664
"Paris, Texas","It is clear-eyed and unsparing, and full of the price our way of life extracts from those who can least afford it emotionally.",664
"Paris, Texas",A rare and fascinating experience for those patient enough to go with its slow flow.,664
Alien 3,[Alien 3] just doesn’t have the same tension and visceral impact that the first two movies did so well.,665
Alien 3,"The movie folds back upon its previous incarnations again and again, never attempting to advance its twice-told tale, content merely to retell once more. What's on screen seems aimed more at making money than making myth.",665
Alien 3,"It is dark, cramped, sweaty; Ripley does struggle with external and internal ""monsters."" But the movie is capable of cheering you, too, for its intelligence, its lack of superficial, groundless flash and for its spare, appropriate use of violence.",665
Alien 3,"The truth of the matter is that Aliens was the logical last act of this saga, establishing a satisfying thematic, dramatic and psychological coda that should never have been disturbed. Alien 3 succeeds only in leaving a very nasty taste in our mouths.",665
Alien 3,"Alien 3 is the most artful entry in the drool-beast series. It gets serious points for cinematography, editing and design. But it hardly generates the requisite shocks its predecessors have so skillfully delivered.",665
Alien 3,One assumes that Weaver received enough combat pay to compensate for playing the now understandably cynical Ripley in this bleak and pointlessly grueling movie.,665
Alien 3,"It does succeed in rounding the three movies off, not smashingly but interestingly. It drives us into the wall, throws Ripley into a blind alley from which, at last, there is no escape hatch.",665
Alien 3,"This third (and, I would guess, last) installment does what few sequels do. It actually extends the story into its logical destination rather than merely recycling familiar characters and situations.",665
Alien 3,"Even though the regal Sigourney Weaver holds her shaved head high all the way through to the end, Alien 3 is a sad way to say goodbye to Hollywood's nastiest screen monster since Jaws.",665
Alien 3,"The monsters just aren't that scary anymore, and so the film mostly just sits there, gloomy and inert, sunk in exhausted myth, looking and sounding Wagnerian but feeling underpowered.",665
Blood For Dracula,Blood for Dracula is a dazzling display of obsessive cinematic structure.,666
Blood For Dracula,"The film has that trademark combination of high artistic ambition and crude pornographic content, sometimes charming or amusing, sometimes repellent.",666
Blood For Dracula,"Not quite as much fun as Frankenstein, but wonderful to look at, with some great jokes - including the myriad of accents displayed by members of the cast. However, as fun as it is at times, it can't compare with Bela Lugosi.",666
Blood For Dracula,"Stylishly directed, atmospheric, funny, and intense enough to please gorehounds--especially at the climax.",666
Blood For Dracula,"Morrisey long showed that his films, although more implicit in sex, drugs and characterizations, were really Hollywood films at the core.",666
Blood For Dracula,One of the two schlocky horror comedies Paul Morrissey made in Italy in 1974... Blood for Dracula is the sexier and funnier.,666
Blood For Dracula,"Outrageous, hilarious and shocking, this is trash art at its very best.",666
Blood For Dracula,"Desperate for virgin blood, [Udo] Kier's wan, fussy vampire strategically heads to Catholic Italy, but the food sucks (""They put so much oil here on everything!"").",666
Blood For Dracula,It's a few bites away from being a delicious spoof on Dracula.,666
Blood For Dracula,"Intentionally camp, and brimming with details of tone and style, the movie tilts into Grand Guinol sequences offset by sex scenes resonating with thematic sand.",666
Audrey Rose,"The acting of Marsha Mason, Anthony Hopkins and debuting Susan Swift are the major assets (poor John Beck is good, but out of his league). The story is intriguing all the way, even if it's never resolved.",667
Audrey Rose,"It turns absurd in the second hour, starting with a trial in which the notion of reincarnation is placed on the stand -- next to this, even Santa’s courtroom appearance in Miracle on 34th Street looks as grounded in reality as the Nuremberg trials.",667
Audrey Rose,Superb performances from Marsha Mason and Anthony Hopkins help ground the supernatural story in genuine human emotion.,667
Audrey Rose,"While some of the acting is overwrought and the story occasionally grates, this choice adds extra layers to what is a fascinating, intelligent and thoughtful psychological drama.",667
Audrey Rose,...a fairly weedy entry in the demonology cycle...,667
Audrey Rose,"The skillful direction of Robert Wise supplies ample suspense, which is not easy because there can be no screaming scenes while the dialogue and explanations are taking place.",667
Audrey Rose,Elegantly directed and beautifully acted.,667
Audrey Rose,Audrey Rose is vulgar and mediocre. [Full Review in Spanish],667
Audrey Rose,"To his credit, Wise took a subtle approach to the material, but Audrey Rose remains a rather uninteresting tale of the supernatural.",667
Audrey Rose,A dull 1977 would-be chiller.,667
Blood Beach,Blood Beach dares to ask the question: What if the sea-with its strong tides and violent creatures-wasn't the scariest part of the beach?,668
Blood Beach,"I, personally, wanted more from it or at least for the film to have a scarier, vicious looking monster and not one that looked like it belonged in a green house.",668
Blood Beach,Let's just say that my favorite scene is where a rapist has his you-know-what eaten by the bloodthirsty beach.,668
Blood Beach,"This movie sucks! (Unfortunately, you'd have to see the movie to get that joke...)",668
Body Snatchers,"[The] camera.. conjures dark beauty and adds hallucinatory planes of color and shadow in a movie shot almost entirely on practical San Francisco locations. [Actors] are all on Kaufman’s wavelength: sustaining mood [in] a feat of shared, uncommon bravura.",670
Body Snatchers,"Kaufman’s invasion tracks the encroachment of consumerist conformity upon the liberated individualism of 60s Frisco – and would acquire new, unintended resonance when its theatrical release was immediately preceded by the collective madness of Jonestown.",670
Body Snatchers,"Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a modernized version of the small masterpiece. The 1978 film is enlarged, and a bit inflated... but the theme is so chilling that is remains alive, in a work of allegorical scares. [Full review in Spanish]",670
Body Snatchers,Philip Kaufman’s remake of the 1956 classic updates it from the homespun innocence small town fifties America to the busy urban modernity of San Francisco of the seventies and gives the metaphor a new context.,670
Body Snatchers,Invasion of the Body Snatchers is more sheer fun than any movie I’ve seen since Carrie and Jaws and maybe parts of The Spy Who Loved Me.,670
Body Snatchers,"The original Invasion of the Body Snatchers from 1956 is great, but Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake is far superior.",670
Body Snatchers,Communism gives way to psychiatry as our boogeymen now come from within in Philip Kaufman’s superior version of the classic story.,670
Body Snatchers,"Surprisingly... the film is a triumph. For once, a remake has not trespassed the original, but re-explored, updated and defined it for a new audience.",670
Body Snatchers,One of the greatest science fiction horror films of all time.,670
Body Snatchers,Philip Kaufman transforms Invasion of the Body Snatchers from an effective remake of a paranoid '50s sci-fi tale into an intertextual narrative and film-watching experience.,670
Bride of Frankenstein,What makes Bride such a powerful entry in the Frankenstein canon—and the classic Universal series as a whole—is its ability to keep its horror under the surface. Only occasionally does it truly allow it to come to the forefront full force...,671
Bride of Frankenstein,The Bride of Frankenstein is without a question the best sequel in the cycle and ranks alongside Frankenstein (if not slightly above it) at the apex.,671
Bride of Frankenstein,"Advertised as a chiller, this film turns out to be something else, having a lot of jollification, nice fancy, elegant mounting -- there is, in short, beauty as well as the beast.",671
Bride of Frankenstein,"It’s no secret that monsters have always appealed to queer folks who see themselves in an “other” that fights eradication, and Bride understands that sentiment perfectly.",671
Bride of Frankenstein,"The baroque blast of stylized design, gothic hysteria and black humor teases, terrifies, and raises the drama to operatic levels.",671
Bride of Frankenstein,"Made by a gay filmmaker in 1935 who understood better than anyone what it was like to be hated for who he was, and crafted as unabashedly queer a film as anything else in Hollywood at the time.",671
Bride of Frankenstein,"Chock full of stunning black and white photography, groundbreaking make-up and special effects, and mad dark comedy, classic horror doesnt get much better than Bride of Frankenstein. It doesnt get much gayer, either.",671
Bride of Frankenstein,A masterpiece of classic horror with plenty of queer subtext to boot.,671
Bride of Frankenstein,"This is an absolutely unforgettable film, a must-see for every gay horror fan.",671
Bride of Frankenstein,"The chief new element is the monster's bride, played by Elsa Lanchester, who doesn't appear in her entirety until approximately five minutes before the movie ends.",671
Candyman,Nia DaCosta and Jordan Peele imbue the horror cult classic with political dimensions that are poignant and darkly comic by turns.,672
Candyman,"Nia DaCosta’s direct sequel to the 1992 original, itself based on a Clive Barker story, is plenty scary with horrors imagined and real.",672
Candyman,"But reframing the legend as a vengeful specter instead of Tony Todd’s romantic, Byronic icon inadvertently erases Anthony’s agency and individuality, and glosses over how Candyman terrorizes his community.",672
Candyman,"The film keeps you on edge the entire way through with its different strains of Horror, Body, Psychological, & Slasher! The film might be too short & rushed but its journey was an impressive one",672
Candyman,"Nia DaCosta does a fabulous job at modernising Candyman; the gore, violent sequences, and general atmosphere are almost suffocating.",672
Candyman,"At its core, Candyman (2021) attempts to explore how Black trauma is intergenerational. Exploring how the atrocities inflicted on our ancestors years prior still affect our lives today.",672
Candyman,"Candyman has style to spare in its horror setpieces, but the script is far too cluttered and confusing for its social commentary to land, despite director Nia DaCosta's best efforts behind the camera.",672
Candyman,"It’s a great idea on the surface, but the story ends up needlessly convoluted and with gaping holes in its logic. And while it seems interested in meaningful topics such as race and gentrification, just referencing them isn’t the same as dealing with them",672
Candyman,"There is hardly a moment when the characters and themes are all that alluring, leaving dissatisfaction at the bungled storytelling that ends on a ridiculous note that is unfulfilling.",672
Candyman,"The ending of the movie doesnt quite work, and comments on contemporary issues such as police violence, gentrification and systemic racism dont always fit with the established mythology of the series.",672
Cape Fear,Yet the grubby story is elevated by a superior cast in both the original and this grimly bloodthirsty remake.,673
Cape Fear,The picture's missteps are more than numerous.,673
Cape Fear,Ever shot reminds you that a consummate artist is having a great time remaking a kinky minor classic.,673
Cape Fear,"Everything is relatively dirty, and no one is truly good, except for this film, it's phenomenal. [Full review in Spanish]",673
Cape Fear,"(De Niro) had played a tough guy before, but never quite like this: a very sinister, very jagged, very dangerous character… put that together with Martin Scorsese at possibly the peak of his powers, and it’s a delightful if slightly scary film.",673
Cape Fear,"Martin Scorsese wasn't supposed to remake the 1962 thriller, but when he did, he brought along his longtime muse and infused the story with an overwhelming amount of trademark chaos...",673
Cape Fear,"It's a mess, really. But what a mess! Why do we call Scorsese one of the great filmmakers of his generation? Because, like all the great ones, even when he fails he fails with style and with wit.",673
Cape Fear,...an exceedingly pulpy and over-the-top thriller that's been suffused with a whole host of appealingly less-than-subtle elements...,673
Cape Fear,Scorsese/De Niro revenge thriller has sexual violence.,673
Cape Fear,"The wrath of De Niro, especially when pitched to the level of a jangle-brained Jehovah, is a mighty thing, but, in this case, its inherent cartoonery capsizes this film's small-story frame.",673
Cat People,One of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.,674
Cat People,"Often cited as Lewton's most personal film, some even calling it his best, The Curse of the Cat People remains unclassifiable and beguiling, yet supremely human in its understanding of and sympathy for the inner workings of a child's mind.",674
Cat People,One of the most curious sequels ever made.,674
Cat People,A seriously oddball sequel...,674
Cat People,[Simone Simon] triumphs in her difficult and very complicated role. [Full review in Spanish],674
Cat People,"The Curse of the Cat People's strongest bits convey the power of suggestibility, while Ollie Reed's bizarre past experiences with Irena seep into their daughter's psychological development.",674
Cat People,"Only a little over a year later, this sequel, which follows everything set up by the original, abandons all that was effective.",674
Cat People,Unexpectedly perceptive in its sympathetic observance of the pangs of childhood and the wondrous possibilities of imagination.,674
Cat People,Despite the snazzy title... Curse of the Cat People has as much pity and tears in it as chills.,674
Cat People,A film that takes the business of childhood completely seriously and aligns itself to a child's perspective with absolute conviction.,674
Nosferatu,Nosferatu (2024) is the finest piece of horror that we have seen in the 2020s. Robert Eggers has carefully crafted each element to ensure that he does this classic story justice while also adding his own wrinkles.,675
Nosferatu,"With a fresh narrative perspective on which Eggers can stake his film adaptation, cinematic fear spreads through outstanding below-the-line craftsmanship, redeeming an emotionless payoff.",675
Nosferatu,"Robert Eggers’ Nosferatu cements his place as a master of the macabre. Evoking terror and intoxicating dread, the film pays homage to F.W. Murnau’s silent classic while establishing itself as its own grotesque and sinister entity.",675
Nosferatu,"Nosferatu is Robert Eggers’ best film yet and a MASTERWORK of horror. Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsgard are immaculate and deliver chilling, bloodthirsty performances.",675
Nosferatu,But we (quite literally) have 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' at home...!,675
Nosferatu,Nosferatu (2024) is much like Count Orlok’s castle. It’s a magnificent piece of visual artistry shrouded in a cold emptiness that cannot be ignored.,675
Nosferatu,Artsy filmmaker Robert Eggers' somewhat over-hyped version of Nosferatu delivers the expected grotesque and macabre in this vampire movie that tends to drag with repetition. The acting and visuals are better than the screenplay.,675
Nosferatu,"Sometimes, though, a ripoff can lead the way to something improbably special. That’s what happened with Robert Eggers’ Nosferatu, and his adaptation must be considered to be in the top tier of vampire movies and one of the best films of the year.",675
Nosferatu,"... its impressive technical and performance precision which truly convince the audience that not everything we see is real and, therefore, almost certainly places us into a lucid state of an inescapable nightmare.",675
Nosferatu,Nosferatu is easily the most intoxicating movie of the year. Eggers never disappoints in creating mood with eccentric characters. Lily Rose Depp is mesmerizing. Bill Skarsgard's Count Orlok is utterly transformative and engaging.,675
"Crucible, The",The Crucible benefits from an increasingly compelling midsection and second half focused on Day-Lewis’ commanding figure...,676
"Crucible, The",Raymond Rouleau’s French-East German coproduction should provide something of a revelation...,676
"Crucible, The","Finally transformed into a chilling and expressive film by Nicholas Hytner, director of The Madness of King George, Miller's script remains a razor-sharp interrogation of religious dread, mob rule, and, most of all, sexual hysteria.",676
"Crucible, The","The Crucible earned two Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Allen) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Miller), but it should have received many more, including one for Best Picture -- it's truly one of the great forgotten films of its era.",676
"Crucible, The","Perhaps understanding the distance that these fictional interpretations have created, The Crucible seems to invite a moral and emotional, rather then political reading.",676
"Crucible, The","The miracle of Nicholas Hytner's rigorous, taut film arises from its ability to capture the high theatricality of its life in the theater.",676
"Crucible, The","A competent, uncontroversial, rather shouty version of a play which is now safely canonical and, if the philistinism may be forgiven, less remarkable than it once seemed, when dramas of the liberal conscience had an urgent edge.",676
"Crucible, The",The clarity of the direction and the quality of the acting make it the best rendition of the author's work that any of us is likely to see either on screen or on stage.,676
"Crucible, The","Plodding film based on play has mature themes, sex, violence",676
"Crucible, The","Then there's always Mr. Scofield, bringing an almost unbearable, yet entirely believable, lightness of spirit to his loathsome character. It's a bold stroke by a great actor, making zealotry and evil seem positively beneficent.",676
Volcano,Tommy Lee Jones might be trapped in this movie while Anne Heche steals the show.,678
Volcano,"Unfortunately, Volcano is also faithful to Hollywood’s legendary lack of originality...",678
Volcano,"The more I watch Volcano, the film holds up as the best volcano movie from 1997 with never-ending action.",678
Volcano,There's a glorious faux-plausibility to the proceedings that makes movies like Volcano all the more entertaining.,678
Volcano,"None of it makes a hell of a lot of sense and the supporting cast are wallpaper thin, but Volcano is at least hot on entertainment.",678
Volcano,"Movies like ``Volcano'' exist for their gigantic, humongous, eye-popping special effects and this picture delivers those -- Big Time.",678
Volcano,"You leave ""Volcano"" feeling a bit singed.",678
Volcano,"Volcano, busily and cheerfully hysterical, always has some new fish to fry, new truck to melt, new skyscraper to tumble or new manhole to pop with a radiant gusher of movie magma.",678
Volcano,Volcano was really ahead of its time and time still hasn't caught up. In Volcano they thought of ways to stop the lava. They weren't going to give up L.A. You don't cast Tommy Lee Jones as the chief of emergency services and ask him to run.,678
Volcano,The fairly anticlimactic final stretch ensures that Volcano concludes on a less-than-engrossing note...,678
Conan the Barbarian,"In many ways silly and strident, it’s still marvelous barbarian pulp, a beefcake fantasy of myth and magic built from grandiose sets, a magnificent score (one of the best from composer Basil Poledouris) and endless he-man matches of blood and brawn.",679
Conan the Barbarian,"Instead of placating his audience with a safe, PG-rated adventure, Milius does the opposite and narrows his viewership with an R-rated epic driven by some heady ideas and a concentration on narrative over adventurous derring-do.",679
Conan the Barbarian,"Conan is terrible, a truly disappointing movie from beginning to end.",679
Conan the Barbarian,"This is a film that lives in moments: the attack on Conan’s village; the “crush your enemies” scene; Conan practicing his swordsmanship on a windswept steppe; all enveloped in Basil Poledouris’ stirring, stentorian, never-bettered score.",679
Conan the Barbarian,"Arnold Schwarzenegger, the muscle man, stars in this mythical beast of a movie, based on pulp magazine tales of the 1930s. He's good as Conan, and the film is technically splendid, especially in the long opening sequences.",679
Conan the Barbarian,"A dynamite movie for comic book fans... The moment Thulsa Doom turns into a snake will either thrill you or make you squirm, but you will watch in fascination.",679
Conan the Barbarian,It doesn't possess the serious edge necessary to effectively realize the source material's formidable warrior (nor does it stay faithful to the origins and conquests).,679
Conan the Barbarian,"In the ongoing Sword-and-Sorcery Sweepstakes, while Conan is -- marginally -- less offensive -- because It Is less pretentious -- than Excalibur, It's nowhere near as good as Dragonslayer.",679
Conan the Barbarian,Its plot is confusing and the production is limited. [Full Review in Spanish],679
Conan the Barbarian,[UPDATED 2024 4K + BLU-RAY REVIEW] A wooden Arnie is not yet seasoned enough to work up the charisma that would serve him well in later roles.,679
Kull the Conqueror,"Some of it is fun, especially when it manages to resemble the likes of Sinbad and his mythological endeavors.",680
Kull the Conqueror,Entertaining and fun for its genre.,680
Kull the Conqueror,not nearly as painful to sit through as expected ... there's enough here to kill 90 minutes without the trade-off of losing too many brain cells,680
Kull the Conqueror,"Yikes. Cribbed dialogue from The Empire Strikes Back is this film's only attempt at quality, and even that falls flat.",680
Kull the Conqueror,A transparent attempt to cash in on the success of TV's Hercules and Xena,680
Kull the Conqueror,"A cheerful, fast-paced entertainment that's truer to the spirit of classic pulp than, say, John Milius' brutal, mean-spirited Conan the Barbarian.",680
Kull the Conqueror,"Just another routine sword-and-sandals action yarn, of the kind that fell out of fashion some years ago.",680
Kull the Conqueror,"Some of it is fun, especially when it manages to resemble the likes of Sinbad and his mythological endeavors.",680
Kull the Conqueror,Entertaining and fun for its genre.,680
Kull the Conqueror,not nearly as painful to sit through as expected ... there's enough here to kill 90 minutes without the trade-off of losing too many brain cells,680
Wishmaster,...a seemingly foolproof setup that's employed to distressingly erratic effect by Kurtzman...,681
Wishmaster,"Little of it makes sense, but the djinn's powers of deception are quite humorous and the look of the picture is unexpectedly impressive.",681
Wishmaster,The joy of Wishmaster [is that] it's a game to see if the audience can out-think and out-predict what the Djinn will do and how he'll do it.,681
Wishmaster,"It starts well enough, with a Hellraiser-esque moment, but soon dissolves into expected horror trope, after horror trope, before an ending that renders the entire movie defunct and unnecessary.",681
Wishmaster,"Some of us started our journey with Wishmaster and through its unbridled sense of silliness; it is our 'classic', our entrance to the genre. What more could we wish for?",681
Wishmaster,A bunch of elaborate gore bits surrounded by a whole lot of stupidity.,681
Wishmaster,Gimmicky but smart horror film.,681
Wishmaster,...two times zero doesn't add up to much.,681
Wishmaster,Sends viewers screaming into the lobby demanding refunds.,681
Wishmaster,My best advice to anyone reading this review -- even someone who considers himself or herself a fan of horror movies -- is to stay away.,681
I Know What You Did Last Summer,"To many people nowadays, the key version of I Know What You Did Last Summer is the film, but the novel, in many respects, better communicates this unique morality tale.",682
I Know What You Did Last Summer,The core cast are undeniable talents and the genuinely surprising story helps keep you engaged in relatively redundant slasher tropes.,682
I Know What You Did Last Summer,"I Know What You Did Last Summer is a welcome hit of nostalgia that still works better than it should, the amazing cast particularly elevating the material enough to still make it a worthwhile rewatch, especially in the weeks of October.",682
I Know What You Did Last Summer,"This is a fun, energetic and scary movie by Jim Gillespie.",682
I Know What You Did Last Summer,"This really does feel like it’s missing something, perhaps the result of being rushed out after the renewed interest in horror post-Scream.",682
I Know What You Did Last Summer,"While not as good as his first film, Williamson still manages to avoid the “sophomore slump” with this second offering and a solid script/story.",682
I Know What You Did Last Summer,"On the minus side, this bright, witty writer seems to have retreated into the very genre he spoofed in Scream.",682
I Know What You Did Last Summer,"Even though the murders are gruesome, the film is not scary, nor is it clever. We've seen this many times before, but with different titles and different stars.",682
I Know What You Did Last Summer,"Takes the foundation of Lois Duncan's source material and updates it in all the right ways. Williamson's script is playful and smart , Gillespie's direction is taunt and SMG remains a queer icon with the best chase scene in modern slasher history",682
I Know What You Did Last Summer,"I Know What You Did Last Summer still retains its entertaining appeal, while still inspiring the filmmakers that have followed in its wake.",682
In the Line of Fire,"A generally smart, adult thriller.",684
In the Line of Fire,"The classic 90s political thriller, complete with an air-tight script for 2+ hours, some great performances and a steady hand from Wolfgang Petersen.",684
In the Line of Fire,"This is a picture which I would simply hate to have missed. It is a totally conventional film, but is none the worse for that. A good movie is a series of gloriously foregone conclusions, and Fire is no exception.",684
In the Line of Fire,Perhaps there is a place still for a film like In the Line of Fire. I'm just not sure we have a Clint Eastwood anymore to save America from itself.,684
In the Line of Fire,"Aside from getting a little too nasty to guarantee audience attention during flat spots, this is a quality political thriller with a few choice personal twists.",684
In the Line of Fire,"A top-notch thriller, the movie's traditional values concerning classic first-responder, law enforcement, and Secret Service/FBI/CIA-agent hero-types who dutifully put their lives on the line for patriotism remains one of the best examples of the genre.",684
In the Line of Fire,John Malkovich plays one of the screen's most memorable and often underrated villains.,684
In the Line of Fire,"Generously exciting, In the Line of Fire is mercifully free of that artificial energy that makes so many new movies look as if they were created with steroids.",684
In the Line of Fire,"...a seriously superior thriller that remains, more than 20 years later, one of the best examples of the genre.",684
In the Line of Fire,"Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, In the Line of Fire builds a palpable tension between the Eastwood and Malkovich characters.",684
Executive Decision,"Tipped as a starry hot property upon its release in 1996, this aviation thriller unfortunately proves to be weighed down by some serious excess baggage.",685
Executive Decision,"For moviegoers, the nerve gas might be no more irritating than the film's preposterous plotting.",685
Executive Decision,"Takes itself very seriously and, though filled with action movie tropes, never becomes a joke.",685
Executive Decision,"Executive Decision is indeed fun to watch if you like bang-bang thrillers. It's nowhere near as inventive and mad as John Woo's recent Broken Arrow, and it rather pointedly. But it has just enough of its own personality.",685
Executive Decision,"A smart, adult thriller...",685
Executive Decision,"It finally gives us what Hollywood has been threatening for years, the movie nobody was waiting for: ""Airport '96.""",685
Executive Decision,A nerve-racking thriller that's more topical today than it was in 1996.,685
Executive Decision,"Take a late-blooming action star and an action hero whose career is in a downslide, and you get an action film seriously lacking in... action.",685
Executive Decision,"Laughably, inexcusably, abjectly awful. How can I even count the ways?",685
Executive Decision,Satisfying junk food.,685
"Perfect World, A",It's an American masterpiece.,686
"Perfect World, A",It will not please everyone because it presents things in shades of gray and takes few easy outs.,686
"Perfect World, A","Tells the tale of an escaped convict and his eight-year-old hostage and, in the process, considers the cycles of disappointment wrought on sons by questionable fathers: abusive ones, absent ones, even a well-meaning ""daddy state."" [Blu-ray]",686
"Perfect World, A",Entertaining manhunt film.,686
"Perfect World, A","Hancock's surface-skimming script is too formulaic for the job. There's enough material here for a crisp 90-minute entertainment. At 2+ hours, the leisurely, mildly engaging A Perfect World barely sputters across the finish line.",686
"Perfect World, A","A tender, poignant, ultimately heartbreaking film filled with haunting, lasting images and nicely eccentric touches. Arguably Costner's best performance, and one of Eastwood's most underrated efforts behind the camera.",686
"Perfect World, A","Right on the heels of his critical and box-office smash Unforgiven, Clint Eastwood made this outstanding, haunting tale of an escaped convict (Kevin Costner in his greatest performance), and it was completely ignored.",686
"Perfect World, A","Stark, gritty story well directred by Eastwood.",686
"Perfect World, A",Moving and totally absorbing.,686
"Perfect World, A",Never once feels like more than push-button artifice.,686
McHale's Navy,"From James Bond, we expect explosions. From McHale's version of the navy, could we have a few laughs?",687
McHale's Navy,All apologies to the handful of Americans who've waited decades for this big-screen update of the '60s sitcom--the result is both awful and awfully irrelevant.,687
McHale's Navy,"A ham-fisted, fitfully amusing lark that quickly runs aground.",687
McHale's Navy,"This shotgun marriage of coarse laughs and low-rent action cliches is, of course, utterly predictable: Cutting-edge comedy isn't lurking under the corpses of old TV shows.",687
McHale's Navy,"The most idiotic, unfunny script imaginable.",687
McHale's Navy,Tom Arnold is no Ernest Borgnine. A profound statement.,687
McHale's Navy,"Dear God, why?",687
McHale's Navy,"[Trots] out the same tired cliches -- unorthodox heroes, inept commanding officers, officious little weasels getting trampled by the zany crew -- which haven't been funny since...well, ever.",687
McHale's Navy,How to turn a so-so series into a witless movie. Earns a half-star for Bruce Campbell.,687
McHale's Navy,"By the end, this soporific comedy makes 105 minutes feel more like a two-year hitch.",687
Leave It to Beaver,"Modernized take on '50s TV show, with some bullying.",688
Leave It to Beaver,Unnecessary film take on the classic TV series. Leave it.,688
Leave It to Beaver,[The] dead-on imitations of some of the characters from the television series created by Bob Mosher and Joe Connelly will seem pointlessly stylized to viewers unfamiliar with the old sitcom.,688
Leave It to Beaver,"All but the most easily pleased kids will be bored as can be, and anyone who has fond memories of TV's Leave It to Beaver would probably rather not besmirch them.",688
Leave It to Beaver,Fuzzily conceived and blandly executed.,688
Leave It to Beaver,Turner is delightful,688
Leave It to Beaver,This. Is. Just. Bad.,688
Leave It to Beaver,"Slight, bouncy and sweet-tempered.",688
Leave It to Beaver,The Cleavers have come to represent the stereotype of the white-bread family.This reverent '90s remake doesn't do much to challenge it.,688
Leave It to Beaver,The result is depressingly halfhearted.,688
Seven Years in Tibet,Too sluggish and fares better as a travelogue than a drama.,690
Seven Years in Tibet,"If the film seems a little like a fairy tale, what can one do with the story of an Olympic skier who ends up as tutor to a boy-king regarded as a god?",690
Seven Years in Tibet,"Unfortunately for Seven Years in Tibet, its focus is on the wrong guy. Harrer may be a fascinating figure in real life, but he never shows up here. The guy we're watching is never anyone but Brad Pitt.",690
Seven Years in Tibet,"Pitt is smiling, taking his shirt off, brushing his blond locks with his hands, striking poses against the picturesque scenery--in short, being Brad Pitt.",690
Seven Years in Tibet,"Part road picture, part epic, and part spiritual journey, Seven Years in Tibet is a beautiful film with a story so typical-yet-unusual that it could only have come from autobiography.",690
Seven Years in Tibet,"I was expecting the worst -- everyone calls this film ""Seven Hours in a Theater."" But really, it's pretty good",690
Seven Years in Tibet,"Failed to convince me that Harrer moved from a self-absorbed bigot to an enlightened being, especially since his memoir never mentioned his Nazi past.",690
Seven Years in Tibet,Most will likely forget about Seven Years in Tibet soon after viewing since the filmmakers have focussed on less interesting aspects,690
Seven Years in Tibet,A movie that makes molasses look fast.,690
Seven Years in Tibet,Ainda tenho aquela sensao de que poderia ter me emocionado muito com esta histria.,690
Dark City,Dark City deftly creates a world both foreign and familiar at the same time to match the clouded tone of its story.,691
Dark City,"This is an exceptionally stylish-looking production driving a story with grand aspirations, and though flawed, like the majority of Proyas’ work, it achieves most of what it sets out to do.",691
Dark City,The movie's design is its only redeeming feature. This is one movie which seems to have been made almost exclusively for members of a Dungeons & Dragons fan club.,691
Dark City,"The other major item of note in the film is its visual effects. From a giant clock to a city changing before our eyes, Dark City is one of the most spectacular visual effects feats to come out in recent memory.",691
Dark City,"Dark City is nearly a nightmare-fueled neo-noir masterpiece. It’s surreal, it’s odd, but it’s also remarkably creative and deserves to be seen.",691
Dark City,Real humanists may have misgivings.,691
Dark City,"Trying for a modernized film noir mixed with gothic science-fiction, the film is a striking blend of genres and motifs.",691
Dark City,"Dark City is unabashed in its eccentricities and relishes the hypnotic, mystifying world it creates.",691
Dark City,"If, for some reason, you have yet to see Dark City, do not hesitate to rent, tune in, or purchase it. It is one of the finest science fiction films of recent memory.",691
Dark City,"'Dark City' is one of those productions that, the more you see it, the more extra details and better feelings it prints. [Full Review in Spanish]",691
"American President, The",What makes both Douglas's president and the movie itself victorious classics is the combination of edge and enchantment.,692
"American President, The","When the focus is on romantic comedy, the film is breezy and amusing; but when it switches to dramas involving fundraising and campaigning, it grows stickier.",692
"American President, The",Despite lapses into sentimental corn-notably in scenes with the president's 12-year-old daughter-director Rob Reiner has crafted a whimsical fable that packs a deceptive punch.,692
"American President, The",My favorite Sorkin film. Great script and wonderful chemistry between the leads,692
"American President, The","Filmmaker Rob Reiner has infused The American President with a breezy, compulsively watchable feel that's perpetuated and heightened by the stars' winning performances...",692
"American President, The",A genial and glossy middle-brow rom/com blended together with corny Capra-like political drama.,692
"American President, The","Light, fluffy romantic comedy, well acted by Michael Douglas.",692
"American President, The","Witty, wise, and idealized political romance.",692
"American President, The","Part romantic comedy, part Capra-corny political drama, this movie exudes so much sympathy, it sweats.",692
"American President, The",A potentially good adult romance is undone by a preachy left-wing agenda.,692
Casino,"A cast of true talent, a Bond girl that can finally tangle with him in smarts, and action that will please even the harshest critics. If you were going to watch only one Bond film, I’d put Casino Royale above all the rest.",693
Casino,This is an excellent espionage picture—one that will blow away any fan of the 007 franchise and pleasantly surprise anyone who didn’t enjoy the films in the past.,693
Casino,Casino Royale is a near-perfect debut of Daniel Craig as the new James Bond.,693
Casino,"Martin Campbell, who revived the franchise once before in Goldeneye, brings a leaner style and a meaner temperament to the series, tossing out gadget-laden spectacle for bare-knuckle battles and adrenaline-pumping stunts with a wincing physicality.",693
Casino,"Where sure its a bit long and a bit forced at times, Casino Royale is easily the closest the Bond franchise has come to a masterpiece so far and probably the closest it will ever get.",693
Casino,The film delivers on gripping action and an enticing narrative that assembles intriguing characters and an emotional center that is very appealing.,693
Casino,Bond the man and Bond the franchise simply never recovered from allowing Vesper Lynd to die.,693
Casino,Casino Royale takes things back to the start for James Bond with a new actor and delivers one of the best films in the franchise.,693
Casino,"One of the best of all Bond movies, and the best in over a quarter century.",693
Casino,"A sharp script, lush direction, impeccable action, a memorably creepy Bond Villain, a bold and brilliant Bond Girl, and the arrival of Daniel Craig; Casino Royale is the greatest Bond film ever made.",693
Persuasion,"The Regency romcom comes with impressive credentials, but it's a complete mess.",694
Persuasion,"Austen has been refashioned before. But Persuasion wants both worlds – the updated story and the historical setting. However, not only does this modern edge not gel with the original novel, but it leads to a questionable tone.",694
Persuasion,Undersells its source material and underestimates Jane Austen fans.,694
Persuasion,"This version of Persuasion has a few terrific things about it, but the overall package is…less than persuasive.",694
Persuasion,"If you take it completely on its own terms and don't see it as an Austen adaptation, there's stuff in it that is fun.",694
Persuasion,Don’t waste your precious time on a film that so profoundly misunderstands the work that it is based on that it makes one wonder if anyone involved in the production actually read the novel.,694
Persuasion,The anachronistic armchair psychology about narcissism and self-care could work if the proceedings were not so dull and angst-filled.,694
Persuasion,Persuasion (2022) does not entirely work because it’s afraid to fully commit to the screwball comedy stylings the film briefly touches upon.,694
Persuasion,"It’s not a bad film, but it’s not a good one either, falling somewhere closer to just “okay.”",694
Persuasion,"Dakota Johnson, as always, looks like a painting in Persuasion. She is so effortlessly hilarious, charming, and undoubtedly gorgeous.",694
Kicking and Screaming,"Baumbach puts his trust in the details, and he gets them right.",695
Kicking and Screaming,"...clever, confessional narcissism.",695
Kicking and Screaming,"For a debut, Noah Baumbach's Kicking and Screaming is an impressive effort, but it lacks the resonance or flexibility of his The Squid and the Whale, released ten years later.",695
Kicking and Screaming,"Mixing the neurotic drive of Woody Allen with the urbane wit of Stillman, this derivative debut presents yet another take on guys who simply can't let go of college--and their adolescence.",695
Kicking and Screaming,"Charts the aimlessness and ennui of four insufferable, maturation-adverse college grads with relaxed realism.",695
Kicking and Screaming,"Not much happens, but it captures that moment between college and the real world with perceptive [occasionally glib] accuracy.",695
Kicking and Screaming,Sporadically funny film with an achingly predictable plot - your enjoyment of this will hinge on whether or not you think Will Ferrell is a Comedy God.,695
Kicking and Screaming,One of the better navel-gazing comedies of this period,695
Kicking and Screaming,Smart and well-performed - captures a time and a feeling with grace and intelligence.,695
Kicking and Screaming,"Baumbach puts his trust in the details, and he gets them right.",695
City Hall,"...a decent-enough endeavor that often feels like it should be much, much better.",696
City Hall,Director Harold Becker captures the political rhythms of the big city and keeps the rather complicated plot comprehensible. But audiences need to pay attention; this is not a by-the-numbers urban thriller.,696
City Hall,"Its chief pleasure is the acting of the big cast, notably Pacino. At 55, he has a haggard, life-wrestling beauty and a street eloquence that has more innocence than De Niro and more sincerity than Nicholson.",696
City Hall,An ambitious but unsatisfying meditation on the morality of power.,696
City Hall,Has all the ingredients for a solid drama but instead comes out a half-baked disappointment.,696
City Hall,Convincing drama about the moral ambiguity of contemporary politics.,696
City Hall,A watchable but never pulsating portrait of mayoral wheeling-dealing.,696

"Basketball Diaries, The","There is no conflict here, just pointless and aimless wandering. It's a downer but, nonetheless, an intriguing DiCaprio performance.",697
"Basketball Diaries, The",DiCaprio's early 90s accomplishments have been widely dismissed or ignored ever since Titanic's Jack Dawson become a beloved movie figure amongst parents and their nostalgia-loving kids.,697
"Basketball Diaries, The",The screenplay could definitely have been better-but it's worth the watch for Leo's performance alone.,697
"Basketball Diaries, The","For as much as The Basketball Diaries wants to claim that it's a realistic portrayal of addiction, it might have done better to root it in its honest time-and-place and play Carroll's story as straight-forward and as honest as they could.",697
"Basketball Diaries, The",What almost saves the muddled pic from fouling out is the raw dynamic performance by Leonardo DiCaprio... .,697
"Basketball Diaries, The",Stark tale of teen drug abuse and delinquency.,697
"Basketball Diaries, The","An uncomfortable experience, to say the least. But also quite rewarding.",697
"Basketball Diaries, The","It was impossible in The Basketball Diaries not to take notice of DiCaprio's seemingly undauntable talent, as he channeled the tortures of the drug-addicted damned. [Blu-ray]",697
"Basketball Diaries, The","...an intoxicating, frightening and emotionally honest essay on the self-destructive impulses of the nascent artist.",697
"Basketball Diaries, The",Di Caprio gives a bravura turn that should've won him an Oscar,697
"Browning Version, The","The Browning Version is not only a very bad film, it desecrates a considerable work of art.",698
"Browning Version, The","Not as good as the original, but Finney is magnificent.",698
"Browning Version, The",The filmmakers lack the confidence to allow us the full measure of Rattigan's uniquely British sensibility.,698
"Browning Version, The",Finney is terrific as a fussy teacher who picks up a few valuable lessons of his own.,698
"Browning Version, The",High-class film about a middle-age teacher who does painful soul-searching.,698
"Browning Version, The","The movie is civilized and literate, and Finney is suitably melancholy in the lead, but somehow there's a lack of fire and spirit.",698
Little Women,Every adaption of Little Women has something that sets it apart from others but few have the sheer emotion and power that we see here with Gerwig’s interpretation. Gerwig uncovers secret layers to the plot that lesser filmmakers would have not noticed,699
Little Women,"Gerwig’s Little Women has all the hallmarks of becoming a beloved Christmas movie, and one that can be enjoyed by not only for little women, but for little men too.",699
Little Women,"Gerwig does not condemn nor condone love and marriage; every character has their own viewpoints and opinions, and their respective struggles make this one of the most moving movie experiences of 2019.",699
Little Women,"Gerwig is more than just one of the best female directors working today; she is one of the best directors working today, period.",699
Little Women,"Though Little Women's talented cast provides more than one noteworthy, giggle-inducing moment, the movie's stylistic choices get in the way of letting any real emotion get through to the audience.",699
Little Women,"Greta Gerwig’s interpretation of Louisa May Alcott’s classic novel Little Women is a joyous and sensitive celebration of family, girlhood, and the resilience of women.",699
Little Women,Gerwig has an incredible ability to create movies that feel lived-in and welcoming. It’s as if the actors and sets existed long before the cameras started rolling and will continue to exist long after they have stopped.,699
Little Women,"Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, and Timothée Chalamet not only deliver the best performances of the film, but their characters carry the most compelling arcs. It's remarkable the level of detail, complexity, and depth that each character has.",699
Little Women,"Little Women is a touching, time-hopping, tour de force of storytelling and filmmaking craft, with a playful, feminist twist.",699
Little Women,"Greta Gerwig’s third film stands as one of the true-blue masterpieces to come out of the 2010s, and it’s probably the best adaptation of Little Women we’ll ever get.",699
Miami Rhapsody,David Frankel's directorial debut...,700

Miami Rhapsody,"We already have a Woody Allen, but thanks anyway for applying.",700

Miami Rhapsody,"Pretty funny, as far as Woody Allen wannabes go.",700
Miami Rhapsody,"Miami Rhapsody has been dismissed in some quarters as an imitation Woody Allen movie, but since the imitation and the movie are both so entertaining, I don't see what the problem is.",700

"Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, The","The movie star who embodied the ideals of a nation hungry for myth and then became one of the prime creators and promoters of that myth, Leni Riefenstahl is the most fascinating and weirdly engaging monster ever recorded on film.",701
"Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, The",This documentary should prove as fascinating to armchair psychologists as it is to film enthusiasts.,701
"Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, The","... it is her unforgettable and, for many, unforgivable achievements in behalf of Hitler that give the program its force.",701
"Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, The",A riveting docu about the controversial filmmaker who made some great propaganda art for Hitler,701
"Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, The","Overlong examination of the life of an enigmatic, willful, disengenuous, fascinating, influential and enormously gifted filmmaker.",701
"Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, The",Fascinating documentary about controversial director Len Riefenstahl.,701
"Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, The",A riveting and encyclopaedic biography of an extraordinary woman. But it also poses heavy questions. Can art ever be isolated from its political context? Are Riefenstahl's claims about her political innocence valid?,701
"Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, The","Mueller's dialectical approach allows him to expose many half-truths (and a few outright lies) by adducing contrary evidence; by the film's end, Riefenstahl's apologia emerges clearly as an elaborate mythification of self and history.",701
"Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, The","This is more often self-portrait than portrait; like Hitler in Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, she's presented as a fully formed deity without family background or ideology save a reverence for beauty and strength.",701
"Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, The",Sometimes clunky but consistently fascinating.,701
Barcelona,[Rebecca Hall] steals the movie from the trio of well-known stars on the poster.,702
Barcelona,"The movie is never as funny or as clever as it tries to be, and it ultimately falls apart in its nonsensical third act.",702
Barcelona,"The worst aspect of Vicky Cristina Barcelona is its attitude toward art and creativity, which is entirely superficial.",702
Barcelona,The Spanish sun has clearly rejuvenated Woody Allen's career. After making three films in London with diminishing returns... he's noticeably benefited from a good dose of Vitamin D: Vicky Cristina Barcelona is his most entertaining movie in years.,702
Barcelona,"This is Allen's most laid-back movie in memory, but the relaxed, carefree vibe does not blunt the edge of the humour. The city of Barcelona is a delight to gaze at throughout too.",702
Barcelona,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a colourful, passionate romantic comedy that - hopefully - marks a return to form for one of the industry's most iconic talents.",702
Barcelona,Truly a ride of pure enjoyment to watch...,702
Barcelona,"Perhaps the biggest surprise, though, is Miss Cruz. She has always been a more than serviceable actress, but here she really shines.",702
Barcelona,"Missing from Vicky Cristina Barcelona are the keenly complex touches that elevated [Woody Allen's] earlier statements on caprice. Then again, that's been gone from his movies for years, and there's vain hope in thinking that Iberia would inspire it again.",702
Barcelona,"This is a slight film, a minor Allen film, a bit of a footnote, but it's warm and engaging and isn't Matchpoint, Scoop or Cassandra's Dream, which has to be a mercy.",702
Widows' Peak,Not since The Crying Game have audiences huddled so steadfastly to keep a secret. Widow's Peak is great fun.,703
Widows' Peak,"Widows' Peak is chiefly a comedy, and the main weakness is the choice of director -- John Irvin -- who is best known for action movies and, on this evidence, should stick with them.",703
Widows' Peak,"Fine Line is trying to lure the same female viewers that embraced Enchanted April to htis mediocre comedy-mystery, starring Mia Farrow in her first non-Wood Allen picture; Joan Plowright as a domineering widow steals the show--again.",703
Widows' Peak,Fun for the whole family. Add a star if you're both Irish and widowed.,703
Widows' Peak,a low-key character comedy that's worth a look,703
Widows' Peak,A diverting and well-acted English film with just the right mix of comedy and mystery.,703
Widows' Peak,"Widow's Peak is another of those sly, witty, quietly ribald comedies that have been coming out of Ireland in the last few years.",703
"House of the Spirits, The",It's artsy polyglot baloney. Not house that's this divided against itself could possibly stand.,704
"House of the Spirits, The","Director Bille August creates striking visuals, and her standout cast never fails to hold attention, though it fails to catch Allende's nuance as a writer.",704
"House of the Spirits, The",The greatest actors in the world can't overcome a script that boils everything down to the Esperanto of cliche.,704
"House of the Spirits, The","Nearly every magic detail, many key characters and half a generation has been sacrificed to clarify the plot. But so much has been cut away that only the skeleton of the story remains.",704
"House of the Spirits, The","If The House of the Spirits fails to reinvent its traditional form as The Piano did, it still redresses Hollywood's usual sexual politics -- and provides an exotic wallow.",704
"House of the Spirits, The","It's also a wretched paradox: a big budget, star-driven art film whose very elements subvert its ambitions and turn it into the thing it least wants to be -- a listless '50s-style Hollywood melodrama.",704
"House of the Spirits, The","The thing works in its goofy way, mainly because Bille August is a man of apparently dauntless conviction. He has written and directed every scene with serene authority.",704
"House of the Spirits, The","The flaws aren't fatal. The beauty and brilliance that might have been, don't preclude the quality and bravery that exist on the screen.",704
"House of the Spirits, The",The House of the Spirits is like Gone With the Wind with the fun and excitement replaced by lofty. All that's left is the wind.,704

Singin' in the Rain,"[It] has been hailed as the greatest American musical ever made. It’s certainly one of the most fun, a knockabout reimagining of the transition from silent to sound movies: lousy history but a blast of singing, dancing, romance, energy and color.",705

Singin' in the Rain,"That iconic imagery of Gene twirling, tapping, stomping, and splashing around lamp posts, puddles, and sidewalks while crooning is fixed in Hollywood legend, but ""Singin in the Rain"" has a lot more going on than just that one song-and-dance number.",705

Bad Moon,"It's impossible to hate any movie in which the hero is a magnificent German Shepherd, but that angle is about all that Bad Moon has going for it.",706
Bad Moon,"""Bad Moon"" isn't a great film, but it is a competent one with enough inspiration and individuality to impress. It is easy to see why it has built up an affectionate little following over the last few decades.",706

Enchanted April,Elegant period film explores deep emotions.,707
Enchanted April,Strong cast's reliable playing is undercut by a script that dawdles over well-trod territory.,707
Enchanted April,"It reminded me of the introspective but otherwise soft-hitting stories that my mother reads in her monthly book club. It's a rich film, but not the kind of rich that I like.",707

Strictly Ballroom,"As kitsch and as corny as anything, this hilarious and heart-warming romantic comedy drama is the ideal pick-me-up. I",709
Strictly Ballroom,Some of it is cheesy and predictable but overall it’s a success.,709
Strictly Ballroom,"It's hard to imagine a more exuberant and sheerly romantic comedy than this Australian import... In its mixture of camp and reality, the film is irresistible.",709
Strictly Ballroom,"This Australian production requires extreme indulgence -- and not the pleasant kind of indulgence, either, the kind in which you feel yourself to be a capital fellow; in this case, you feel that someone has made a fool of you.",709

Better Off Dead...,"Savage Steve Holland, along with Cusack and the rest of his cast, accomplish something unique with Better off Dead. At the surface, the film exhibits the same regressive political traits as many of its contemporary peers.",710
Better Off Dead...,I just think it's really funny.,710
Better Off Dead...,There's a potentially edgy aspect to Better Off Dead's comedy that's never fully realized.,710
Better Off Dead...,"Mired in this is Cusack (""The Sure Thing""), an unusually adept verbal comedian not so adept (to his credit) at this kind of slapstick.",710
Better Off Dead...,"Full of...goofy ironies, and while it ain't Molire, it is a pretty great entry in the teen-comedy genre. [Blu-ray]",710
Better Off Dead...,"Unfortunately, only about half of the many jokes and gags in the film are actually funny.",710
Better Off Dead...,Hilarious and brilliantly deadpan.,710
Better Off Dead...,I've rarely met anyone who didn't secretly love it passionately.,710

Tin Men,"It is a brilliant, touching, and hilarious reminder that the crazy jerk who just rear-ended us is only another confused soul trying to find his way home.",712
Tin Men,"Despite having a lot of rich potential in its premise, it is closer to mediocrity. [Full Review in Spanish]",712
Tin Men,"It captures the circularity and inconsequentiality of everyday speech, without flagging, and without becoming for a moment less than entertaining.",712
Tin Men,"Levinson has an unerring eye for the trappings of the period, and like Diner, the supporting characters add a realism that is often forgotten in the 'big movie' mentality of the 80s.",712
Tin Men,The period comedy film is a rich character study that offers a ride as smooth as a Coupe de Ville.,712
Tin Men,"Levinson's follow-up to Diner has strong characters, funny dialogue, and terrific ensemble, but the film is dramatically shapeless.",712
Tin Men,"curioso: embora se esforce ao mximo para funcionar como comdia, este filme merece crditos por narrar o drama de dois homens de meia-idade frustrados com suas vidas.",712
Tin Men,Irritating and painful.,712
Tin Men,Zany and thought-provoking social comedy,712
Tin Men,"Primo Levinson. DeVito's rarely been more human, and Dreyfuss is at his funniest.",712
Othello,Laurence Fishburne does one helluva job portraying the famous Moor straight out of the pages of Shakespeare.,713
Othello,Anna Patrick is particularly impressive in the usually overlooked role of Emilia.,713
Othello,"Like its hero, Oliver Parker's Othello starts mightily -- resplendent and captivating -- before crumpling under the weight of misguided choices and self-delusion.",713
Othello,"Laurence Fishburne is an actor of no little talent, but he lacks Othello's martial bearing and heroic stature.",713
Othello,"Branagh, as Iago, is so obviously the best thing in this largely uninteresting interpretation that you feel sorry for him when he inevitably bites the big one.",713
Othello,"A decent but not great version that makes Shakespeare's reliable play accessible, but the acting is uneven: Branagh is witty as Iago, Fishburne looks but doesn't sound right, and Jacob is pale as Desdemona.",713
Othello,A highly engaging attempt at Shakespeare's most domestic tragedy.,713
Othello,"An entertaining, respectful adaptation that plays like an erotic thriller with Elizabethan language.",713
Othello,"Fishburne gives an amazingly chilling turn; when his Othello receives the Bad News about his lady love, Fishburne positively radiates homicide.",713
Othello,Fine Shakespeare adaptation,713
Carrington,The acting is great and the story is unbelievable especially given its time period and the fact that it is based on a true story. Check it out.,714
Carrington,"For ail its grace, Carrington is a superficial treatment of an urbane but obscure bunch",714
Carrington,Even those unfamiliar with Strachey's biographies may be fascinated by Jonathan Pryce's impersonation of him in Carrington.,714
Carrington,A lot has gone wrong. The film suffers from too much detail and too little change of pace.,714
Carrington,This is Hampton's impressive debut as a director; he tells his story with a tactful English reserve that allows deep feelings to find their own way to the surface. He's given a great assist from Michael Nyman's score.,714
Carrington,We feel a tingle of anticipation that this picture is going to be handled intelligently. And it is.,714
Carrington,Cowardly and dull.,714
Carrington,One of those pretty terrific movies that has somehow just fallen by the wayside in our collective cinematic consciousness.,714
Carrington,Jonathan Pryce dominates the film with his fussy and idiosyncratic performance as the outspoken homosexual and iconoclastic chronicler of 20th century excesses.,714
Carrington,What's the point?,714
To Die For,"Without Suzanne Stone, there would be no Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian. And now, with social media, we can curate and broadcast our own existence – imagined or otherwise.",715
To Die For,"first and foremost an exercise in bold style, with Van Sant throwing out the traditional playbook and thereby turning what might have otherwise been a Lifetime-esque potboiler into a thrilling, darkly humorous cinematic experiment",715
To Die For,"Boasts an impressive cast that includes three future Oscar winners and a tale of unbridled ambition that could've made for a riveting experience, but sadly it's all undone by a rather inexplicable, puzzling structure that reveals far too much too early.",715
To Die For,"In the way it cavorts with teen melodrama, black comedy, and docu-realism to reflect Suzanne’s contradictory masks, To Die For is a comic precursor to Gus Van Sant’s Elephant.",715
To Die For,"The more I revisit the film, though, it’s Joaquin Phoenix and Alison Folland as James and Lydia, the teens most closely involved with Suzanne, who really give it its exceptional shape.",715
To Die For,"The film, adapted by Buck Henry from Joyce Maynard’s novel, is smartly structured, but Van Sant’s touch is uncertain: the story’s satirical bite begins to loosen as his camera lingers more and more on the disaffected teen-agers.",715
To Die For,"Furiously paced and sharply funny, To Die For doesn't try for subtlety; its laughs are delivered with self-consciously heavy hands.",715
To Die For,"""To Die For"" has a crisp professional snap, as if the producer had splashed cold water on Van Sant between takes.",715
To Die For,A hilarious satiric treat.,715
To Die For,"Aside from outstanding performances, the movie is smartly paced and well designed. Most of all, it delivers fascinating characters and provocative ideas with skill and grace.",715
Home for the Holidays,Celebrates the family unit without ever getting sanctimonious about its merits.,716
Home for the Holidays,"Single mom Holly Hunter is fired from her job at a Chicago museum on the very day she is due to fly back to Baltimore to cope with nutty parents, loony aunt, wacky gay brother and boring sister. That's it -- that's the plot. Read it and weep.",716
Home for the Holidays,"The Larsons aren't [a] fake sort of sitcom-y zany ... They're the mix of pent-up emotions, unspoken admiration, lifelong grudges, and unconditional love that's reflected in the grand majority of real, American families.",716
Home for the Holidays,Home for the Holidays is a perfect representation of why they say you can't go home again.,716
Home for the Holidays,"Funny, adult look at a dysfunctional holiday.",716
Home for the Holidays,"Foster's second directorial effort is a vividly drawn if too episodic portrait of an eccentric family, well acted by the entire cast, especially Holly Hunter and Robery Downey Jr.",716
Home for the Holidays,Jodie Foster has directed a poisoned paean to the great American tradition of torturous family gatherings.,716
Home for the Holidays,This has its fair share of laugh out loud moments and a good deal of heart.,716
Home for the Holidays,"Has a spirit and an ostensible shapelessness that are pure Cassavetes, enveloping a script that only seems to reach for the precise calculations of 1930s screwball comedy.",716
Home for the Holidays,"A wonderful, big-hearted, messy Thanksgiving story.",716
"Juror, The","At first glance, this seems like another typical ""woman being victimized"" movie that's pretty predictable, but its ending may surprise you.",717
"Juror, The","Tremendously trashy courtroom drama that improves as its silly premise just keeps on getting, well, sillier.",717
"Juror, The","The film's uneven atmosphere is especially disappointing given the irresistible, seemingly foolproof premise and effectiveness of the stars' performances...",717
"Juror, The","A tightly-wound thriller that succeeds to the degree it does because of Alec Baldwin's sinister performance, which somehow captures the pathos of his monstrous character.",717
"Juror, The","Despite its big names and slick sheen, [the film] fails to make a convincing case.",717
"Juror, The",Psycholgical thriller about a woman in jeopardy and a power hungry criminal.,717
"Juror, The",Moore needs The Juror like she needs another scarlet letter; the 'D-for-dopey' here is hanging down to everyone's knees.,717
"Juror, The","Without revealing plot twists, I will say that the movie goes on a long while -- a very long while -- after the trial is over, and that a trip to the jungles of Guatemala is unnecessary, to put it mildly.",717
"Juror, The","At first glance, this seems like another typical ""woman being victimized"" movie that's pretty predictable, but its ending may surprise you.",717
"Juror, The","Tremendously trashy courtroom drama that improves as its silly premise just keeps on getting, well, sillier.",717
In the Bleak Midwinter,I didn’t think the film managed the transition from cynical comedy to heartstring-tugging as deftly as S&A usually does–its heartfelt elements were a bit shopworn–but it was still a real pleasure.,718
In the Bleak Midwinter,"This small-scale, putatively comic meditation on the anxieties and joys of the theatrical life says nothing fresh about the artistic process and manages to be coy and grating in doing so.",718
In the Bleak Midwinter,A palpable hit.,718
In the Bleak Midwinter,"Excellent, hilarious bookend to Branagh's Hamlet. If you or someone you love is in theatre, you must watch.",718
In the Bleak Midwinter,"A Midwinter's Tale"" packs together so many characters and ideas that they crowd one another out, leaving enough room for plenty of chuckles but none for belly laughs.",718
In the Bleak Midwinter,One of Branagh's most charming works too little seen.,718
In the Bleak Midwinter,"A nice viewing alternative to the usual Christmas pap, and goes well with a fireplace and a snowy December day.",718
In the Bleak Midwinter,Delivers a bittersweet portrait of the trials and surprising rewards that come with being part of a theatre company.,718
In the Bleak Midwinter,A seriously funny ensemble farce.,718
In the Bleak Midwinter,"Although this is clearly a warmup for Branagh's full-length dramatic ""Hamlet,"" at 100 minutes it's pleasant enough for whiling away a bleak midwinter night.",718
Canadian Bacon,The premise behind Canadian Bacon is so absurd that it could very well have come from the mind of Mel Brooks.,719
Canadian Bacon,It takes a promising idea and mostly surrounds it with dull characters and insipid scenarios.,719
Canadian Bacon,It is painful to watch the documentary maverick of Roger and Me make such a botch of his actors in Canadian Bacon.,719
Canadian Bacon,"A limp, ill-scripted caper.",719
Canadian Bacon,"Moore's agit-prop is mildly amusing, but far too preachy to hold water.",719
Canadian Bacon,"Moore's only non-docu is a misfire, a diffuse, unfunny political satire that only John Candy's most avid fans might enjoy.",719
Canadian Bacon,Falls entirely short of its potential,719
Canadian Bacon,Let's leave the poking fun at Canadians to those who do it best - Canadians.,719
Canadian Bacon,"A funny, underrated little gem that doesn't say much for Michael Moore as a fictional director, but does showcase his talents as a writer. The last decent John Candy film.",719
Canadian Bacon,A dreadful waste of top talent.,719
First Knight,...a slow-moving historical drama that’s generally only engrossing in fits and starts...,720
First Knight,It's hard not to wonder... about Ormond besieged by Connery on one side and Gere on the other. Why won't the movie let them look for someone their own age?,720
First Knight,A few large-scale battles and lengthy action sequences can't save the film from its exhausting stereotypes and sappy storyline.,720
First Knight,Excali-BORE.,720
First Knight,A stock bodice-ripper - albeit one in which all bodices survive intact.,720
First Knight,"While director Jerry Zucker seems to have been intent on dragging the film to the mushy middle, it's still more entertaining than most comparable Middle Ages-set movies.",720
First Knight,Goes for a pass as a shallow but occasionally rousing swordfighting flick with a handful of thoughtful scenes...has something those other pictures don't have: Sean Connery as King Arthur.,720
First Knight,"Director Zucker is unsuccessful in trying to put a fresh angle on the familiar story, and he is not much helped by his romantic leads, Richard Gere and Julia Ormond.",720
First Knight,The out-of-place [Richard] Gere doesn't do justice to the fine performance of [Julia] Ormond.,720
First Knight,"No Merlin, no magic, no way.",720
Mallrats,"...a rough-around-the-edges and fairly low-rent comedy that benefits substantially from its affable, easygoing sensibilities and raft of appealing performances...",721
Mallrats,"While Mallrats does play better now than when it was originally released, it still rests below a handful of more accomplished titles in Smith's View Askewniverse.",721
Mallrats,"London and Lee expertly lead this cast of ""misfit toys"" in an appropriate follow up to Smith's debut, Clerks.",721
Mallrats,Thin yet enticing.,721
Mallrats,How can a reviewer write about a movie that makes Dumb and Dumber seem like a Merchant-Ivory production?,721
Mallrats,"Smith manages to successfully subsume his slackers feel into a more cartoony aesthetic. And the mall ode-cum-satire, like with Clerks' convenience store, is brilliantly done.",721
Mallrats,"Retains enough Smith-isms to help navigate all potholes in execution. Flawed, yes, but Mallrats has its charms when it isn't shoving its hand up its own hindquarters.",721
Mallrats,Typical Kevin Smith fare; not suitable for kids.,721
Mallrats,"Almost everyone has lively things to say, the topics usually centering on the Kevin Smith triumvirate of sex, comics, and movies.",721
Mallrats,"Ragged, messy, and flat, this is Kevin Smith's sophomore jinx; coming right after Clerks, it was a huge artistic and commercial flop",721
Nine Months,...a somewhat erratic yet mostly entertaining comedy...,722
Nine Months,The script is straight drivel...,722
Nine Months,"Nine Months is a fast, funny winner.",722
Nine Months,"Any charm he might possess has been squeezed out by the Hollywood machine, and the little shots of Hugh rollerblading, or Hugh getting his ears pierced, are scarcely enough to create new endearments.",722
Nine Months,[Grant's] mannerisms were endearing in Four Weddings And A Funeral. They are more of an endurance now.,722
Nine Months,Nine Months needed a lot longer gestation.,722
Nine Months,[Nine Months] threatens to turn an interesting actor into a self-parodying commodity.,722
Nine Months,"Dated romcom is filled with profanity, sex, and stereotypes.",722
Nine Months,The movie felt longer.,722
Nine Months,"Breezy, undemanding, and ultimately forgettable.",722
Boys on the Side,...an amiable endeavor that benefits substantially from the top-tier efforts of its three stars...,723
Boys on the Side,"There's something strangely endearing about Boys on the Side. Perhaps it's the basic humanity woven into the movie's story, or the boundless optimism at its very heart.",723
Boys on the Side,"An engagingly acted, likable, fried green Thelma & Louise.",723
Boys on the Side,"Boys on the Side isn't a profound film or even, given the TV-movie nature of its ""predicaments,"" an especially risky one. But it's solidly endearing in terms of emotion, humor and character.",723
Boys on the Side,"Goldberg and Parker are funny and affecting, but the real treat is Barrymore.",723
Boys on the Side,"I enjoyed every minute of it, and was moved to tears at least a dozen times. It's a brave movie, and it challenges the acceptability of prejudices that are the root of some of the most dangerous social problems of our time.",723
Boys on the Side,"This is for the same audience who loved Friend Green Tomatoes and Thelma and Louise, which also are movies about women banding together for strength.",723
Boys on the Side,"Despite ads that present it as a giddy romp, Boys on the Side actually proves to be a wistful romance, a sardonic comedy, a Thelma, Edna and Louise tale of sisterly solidarity, and finally a sad, wrenching story that brings Terms of Endearment to mind.",723
Boys on the Side,"It's an original, and what it does best is show how strangers can become friends, and friends can become like family.",723
Boys on the Side,The three women are so spirited and funny -- so emotionally keyed into all the hearts and flowers -- that they give the movie their own kind of truth.,723
Circle of Friends,"Great film acting is often like bottling magic, but it usually involves an inscrutable face that hides an internal life that is rich and curious and ever-moving. Driver, like Clayburgh, has that type of enigmatic charm.",724
Circle of Friends,"An enchanting, if denture-rottingly sweet, yarn.",724
Circle of Friends,"A familiar tale of busty lasses and lusty lads, it's lent extra weight by fine writing and accomplished performances.",724
Circle of Friends,"Driver, who delivers a piercingly subjective performance, is the linchpin of the film's quiet appeal.",724
Circle of Friends,"Three female friends grow up in a small town in Ireland in the mid-50s and attend college in Dublin in this nostalgic soap opera that's vaguely evocative of Peyton Place, though generally less memorable.",724
Circle of Friends,"Old-fashioned and nostalgic, Pat O'Connor's nicely directed tale of friendship between three Irish girls features a strong central performance from Minnie Driver that promises a bright future in Hollywood pictures.",724
Circle of Friends,"Sweet Irish melodrama, with a hilariously oily performance by Alan Cumming.",724
Circle of Friends,"The fizzing dialogue gets all the little details right, but the plot's nothing new, and the lingering shots of hibernian greenery aim straight for mid-Atlantic bland-out.",724
Circle of Friends,"Beyond eliciting warm, animated performances from his actors (with a cast that also includes Alan Cumming as a hair-raising suitor of Benny's), Mr. O'Connor gives Circle of Friends an enveloping look and sound.",724
Circle of Friends,It's intelligent and moving and it never resorts to cheap melodrama.,724
Exit to Eden,"It's more successful at mild erotica than it is with comedy, but its ineffectiveness is notable on both counts.",725
Exit to Eden,Every actor looks rightly embarrassed.,725
Exit to Eden,"From the outset, Marshall covers himself with shame as he clumsily juggles a caper comedy with old-fashioned soft porn.",725
Exit to Eden,As awful as its reputation,725

Exit to Eden,"On the first page of my notes, I wrote ""Starts slow."" On the second page, I wrote ""Boring."" On the third page, I wrote ""Endless!"" On the fourth page, I wrote: ""Bite-size Shredded Wheat, skim milk, cantaloupe, frozen peas, toilet paper, salad stuff...""",725
Fluke,"""Fluke"" gives new meaning to the phrase ""men are dogs."" In this cute new adventure film, Fluke is the canine reincarnation of a man who died in a freak auto accident.",726
Fluke,"There are some interesting twists at the film's conclusion, but by then, the heaviness and quirkiness of it all may have diluted most of the fun.",726
Fluke,"Dog tale with death, danger more intense than you expect.",726
Fluke,"This strange family fare, about a dog that was once a man, tries unsuccessfully to combine the expected magic of animal adventures with some more serious ideas.",726
Fluke,Touching in a shaggy dog sort of way.,726
Fluke,Terrible dog movie. Schmaltzy family crap.,726
Fluke,It deals with challenging issues for the younger crowd in a sensitive manner and is still able to avoid patronizing the parent viewers.,726
Fluke,Fluke has some interesting points to make about animals and about living in the present moment.,726
Fluke,"As if banal platitudes about work-vs. -family aren't insufferable enough, there's a kicker gag involving Jackson that'll even have Mister Rogers begging for Pulp Fiction II.",726
Immortal Beloved,"Quality dressings can distract from, but never disguise, a weak body.",727
Immortal Beloved,"Music scholars have challenged the film's authenticity, but they cannot dispute the magnificent image-making by director Bernard Rose.",727
Immortal Beloved,"It may be a cartoon. Yet, with Beethoven's compositions crashing and storming around him, it's a cartoon that has some dark, harrowing grandeur.",727
Immortal Beloved,"The results are always excessive and sometimes quite aggravating, but they're weirdly appropriate to the subject of the story, an over-the-top artiste who seemed excessive and aggravating to many of his 19th-century cronies.",727
Immortal Beloved,"Despite Oldman's powers, this adds up to a less than immortal musical love story.",727
Immortal Beloved,"Yes, this is another one of Hollywood's silly symphonies, an unintentionally amusing bit of piffle that allows mortals a privileged glimpse into the private life of a legendary composer.",727
Immortal Beloved,"Ultimately, Beloved has all the sound and fury of Beethoven's music but none of its emotional resonance.",727
Immortal Beloved,"Puffed up and pompous, but puny, this is a stodgy pudding of a film that moves at a snail's pace and tries unsuccessfully to accommodate wildly different performing styles from actors of various countries.",727
Immortal Beloved,"Moments like these may lift Immortal Beloved high enough for even the most skeptical of purists to forgive it. Moments like these and, of course, all that glorious music.",727
Immortal Beloved,"Immortal Beloved is pure historical hokum. Nevertheless, it is an absorbing motion picture and a heady blend of stellar performances, spectacular backdrops and crafty screenwriting.",727
Junior,...an appealingly high-concept premise that’s employed to mostly watchable yet entirely disposable effect...,728
Junior,"The fact remains that patriarchal comedy is the operative mode here, and every gesture made to alter that is strictly salad dressing.",728
Junior,Arnold delivers a fine performance.,728
Junior,Unusual science fiction set in contemporary times rather than the future.,728
Junior,"The wait pays off. When the Big Guy starts showing, and begins to get that radiant glow, Junior hits its mellow, endearing comic stride.",728
Junior,"This comedy is to this year's holiday season what Mrs. Doubtfire was to last year's, a mildly funny but utterly conventional and obvious farce.",728
Junior,Not one of Schwarzenegger's best,728
Junior,"To quote Last Action Hero: ""Big mistake!""",728
Junior,"Cute, amusing, but never hilarious.",728
Junior,"A histria absurda, mas esta uma daquelas comdias leves que servem como bom passatempo.",728
Nell,"The film Nell featured Miss Foster, and was a tour de force (whatever that may mean).",729
Nell,"Jodie Foster's performance is much better than the movie, but Nell is still one of those movies you should see.",729
Nell,"All of this proves somewhat uplifting and, in the end, fairly moving. Under Apted's caring direction, Foster gives a fearless, appealing, utterly uninhibited performance throughout.",729
Nell,Stunningly awful on almost every level.,729
Nell,"Somber, ponderous, and pretentious, this is a clinical study of a wild woman (Jodie Foster) raised in the backwoods, far from the interference and contamination (according to the film) of Civilization. It's better to see Truffaut's Wild Child.",729
Nell,Decent triumph over adversity movie. Nell has a unique disability.,729
Nell,Jodie Foster is totally immersing,729
Nell,"The film Nell featured Miss Foster, and was a tour de force (whatever that may mean).",729
Nell,"Jodie Foster's performance is much better than the movie, but Nell is still one of those movies you should see.",729
Nell,"All of this proves somewhat uplifting and, in the end, fairly moving. Under Apted's caring direction, Foster gives a fearless, appealing, utterly uninhibited performance throughout.",729
Queen Margot,"If you like historical costume pieces, this is your ticket. Be warned, though, that the level of violence is high.",730
Queen Margot,"An elegant costume drama with significant historical context reconstructed as a soap opera of sexual conquests hidden by the veneer of warring religious regimes, Queen Margot is scintillating cinema.",730
Queen Margot,"It's Romeo and Juliet knee-deep in carnage, staged with Jacobean fury, lurid sensuality and high style by the recklessly gifted Chereau.",730
Queen Margot,"The achievement of Chereau's film is to reveal the people, in all their squalor and occasional grace, behind the myth of royalty -- that, and to make two-and-a-half hours zip by.",730
Queen Margot,Queen Margot is one of the great modern historicals. This is not a polite drawing-room story of men in tights and women in ruffled collars.,730
Queen Margot,"That's a lot of plot-and plotting-to sort out, and while Chreau and co-writer Danile Thompson occasionally fail to explicate it clearly, the center of the film holds strong.",730
Queen Margot,"A model of heaving, combustible history, in which period lavishness and performance energy aren't mutually exclusive.",730
Queen Margot,"Among its many other accomplishments, 'Queen Margot' deserves a special prize for its inventive use of poisons - one receives ""death by book.""",730
Queen Margot,"Death seems to linger in every inch of the frame, yet the film lives and breathes like few others.",730
Queen Margot,"Though Queen Margot's sound, sets, costumes, and camerawork collectively stun, Chreau prioritized his actors, and he gave his ensemble ample freedom to perform.",730
"Corrina, Corrina","For the most part, the actors are asked to play social types rather than real characters.",731
"Corrina, Corrina",Whoopi's great triumph is that she plays the kind of maid that has never been seen on the screen before...Whoopi's liberated maid is a symbolic payback of sorts for all those years of silver screen servitude for black actresses.,731
"Corrina, Corrina",A preachy and manipulative tearjerkering melodrama that mishandles its pseudo-emotional longwindedness. Goldberg and Liotta derved better than this punctuated pap,731
"Corrina, Corrina","Whoopi, Whoopi, no, no.",731
"Corrina, Corrina",Whoopi's performance makes it watchable.,731
"Corrina, Corrina",Actually fairly entertaining in a boring sort of way.,731
"Corrina, Corrina",An overlooked gem,731
"Corrina, Corrina","Reveals that loyalty to life, not to time, is what heals those in deep grief.",731
"Corrina, Corrina","Corrina, Corrina has its heart in the right place, and its characters are some of the nicest people I've met at the movies lately, but the movie seems to exist under a cloud of gloom, and I kept hoping for sunshine.",731
Dave,"None of this is terribly surprising dramatically, but Bank of Dave sucks you in.",732
Dave,"Had Dave lived in the jungle, he would have been the village doctor. The story of how the real-life Dave Fishwick of Burnley, England started his own bank to help his struggling friends is a warm, fuzzy reminder that humans are capable of goodness.",732
Dave,"Bank of Dave is an entertaining and light British comedy that, although it may not reach the masterpiece category, leaves the viewer with a nostalgic smile. [Full review in Spanish]",732
Dave,Some will gravitate to the warmth of a movie like this but Bank of Dave is painfully cheesy and not worth enough to make a withdrawal.,732
Dave,It takes great liberties with the factual backstory... [But] I'm glad they embellished it. It makes for a much more enjoyable film.,732
Dave,The most charming and delightful movie of the week. I was really happy to have something brighten my day.,732
Dave,The true story behind Bank of Dave is somewhat embellished here -- adding a dramatic court case and even a Def Leppard concert -- but the good intentions and strong heart remain front and center.,732
Dave,"Fry is natural, Dynevor is charming, and Kinnear is positively heroic in making everything sound like something a person would normally say.",732
Dave,"Everyone loves a good underdog story, and Bank of Dave fits that mold, despite needing to be tighter.",732
Dave,"This one is purely out to charm, and it does periodically, handed some lift by energetic performances and a buttery reminder of good people trying to do good things for one another.",732
Go Fish,"A resourcefully no-budget, B&W ensemble romp of romantic entanglements.",733
Go Fish,"When we watch a new movie and see something we rarely see, it feels revolutionary.",733
Go Fish,"Go Fish is a sweet romantic fantasy, totally dreamed up by lesbians. [Full review in Spanish]",733
Go Fish,"A groundbreaking new film about life and love, offering a candid slice of urban lesbian life in 90's.",733
Go Fish,"Go Fish was made with hardly more than petty cash and the devotion of a mostly female cast and crew who gave their weekends for a year to this labor of love. Despite the film's problems, it's the devotion and love you'll remember.",733
Go Fish,"The central romance has a lot going for it, working at the stuttering rate of progression of real relationships.",733
Go Fish,"Go Fish is a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful film. If you don't believe me, throw this paper down and go see for yourself.",733
Go Fish,"Combining the urban smarts of Spike Lee with the ang-sty intimacy of a Sadie Benning video, Troche and Turner zero in on the streets of Chicago and a circle of friends who call the city home.",733
Go Fish,"The flexible digressive style enables Troche and Turner to dive a little deeper under Go Fish's seemingly light, shimmery surface and ponder on some weightier questions about lesbian identity -- but without letting the movie get too hung up on them.",733
Go Fish,"The co-writer and director, Guinevere Turner, reveals herself as an extremely watchable star in her own movie, which showcases her comic and dramatic talent.",733
Made in America,"But in terms of achieving cheap laughs, this movie doesn't care about making sense. Its weakness is that it succumbs to the kind of dumb humor that runaway elephants supply.",734
Made in America,...a predominantly affable comedy that benefits from the thoroughly compelling and charming efforts of its stars...,734
Made in America,"Benjamin gives the film a sunny, screwball feeling and works nicely with a charming cast.",734
Made in America,"This first-time screenplay by Holly Goldberg Sloan feels more like an outline, and director Richard Benjamin doesn't seem to know quite what to do with it.",734
Made in America,A fun time capsule with a very likable cast.,734
Made in America,"Has anyone else noticed the apparent subtext that black men are unstable and unreliable, and only a white man can be sensitive to a black woman's needs?",734
Made in America,About the least funny comedy ever created.,734
Made in America,"But in terms of achieving cheap laughs, this movie doesn't care about making sense. Its weakness is that it succumbs to the kind of dumb humor that runaway elephants supply.",734

Made in America,"Benjamin gives the film a sunny, screwball feeling and works nicely with a charming cast.",734
Philadelphia,"It’s an irresistible and painfully funny film, bolstered by one of the best love triangles you’re going to get in a romantic comedy. This one practically wrote the book on how the screwball comedy functions at its peak. It’s a must-see.",735
Philadelphia,"Hepburn is a goddess, Stewart understands Connor’s purpose in the story, and Cukor masterfully pulls everything together.",735
Philadelphia,"This is a paste diamond with more flash and sparkle than a true one. The director, George Cukor, has never been more heartlessly sure of him- self.",735
Philadelphia,"Without its trio of legends and a few well-placed zingers, it would be long forgotten, lost in a mist of ideas that have aged like a banana in the sun.",735
Philadelphia,"A witty, wordy masterpiece.",735
Philadelphia,Philip Barry should be very grateful for the direction of George Cukor and the adaptation of Donald Ogden Stewart. He is equally fortunate in the casting of the film.,735
Philadelphia,"Pardon us a moment, please, while we dip into our supply of superlatives and bring up quite a few to bestow upon Philadelphia Story... Here, boys and gals, is the most sparkling comedy to reach the screen in lo! these many moons.",735
Philadelphia,Miss Hepburn has accomplished the thing she set out to do with both movie and stage play. She has made the showmen who labeled her boxofrice poison eat their words and rue the day they were ever so uncomplimentary.,735
Philadelphia,"Miss Hepburn scores heavily, giving the best performance of her career. Grant also licks. Our favorite Ruth Hussey, who heads the featured cast, also has a field day.",735
Philadelphia,"Barry's sprightly lines and the almost equally bright additional Stewart dialogue, of course, make the play the thing. But, frankly, it would be hard to imagine The Philadelphia Story without Katharine Hepburn.",735
Shadowlands,Beautiful film about marriage and how faith can help you get through the toughest of times,736
Shadowlands,"It's not hard to see what drew Richard Attenborough to the story. It is a character-driven piece with two potent leading roles, and he is a former actor known for teasing outstanding performances from his cast.",736
Shadowlands,"Biting down on his pipe, his shirt collar permanently askew, Hopkins assays another concerted study in English repression -- a condition unexpectedly relieved by Winger's brash intelligence and brittle wit.",736
Shadowlands,Superlative acting by Hopkins and Winger elevates this fictionalized late-in-life romance between the repressed British scholar and writer C.S. Lewis and the American Jewish housewife-poet who introduces him to sex and rejuvenates his life.,736
Shadowlands,This is the biggest tear-jerker you could ever see.,736
Shadowlands,Really Touching stuff. Performances get no better,736
Shadowlands,"Here is Mr. Hopkins giving an amazingly versatile and moving performance, shifting the light in those knowing blue eyes to reveal endless shadings between delight and sorrow.",736
Shadowlands,"Glossy and effective, but not as good as the Joss Ackland version.",736
Shadowlands,Anthony Hopkins gives one of his best performances (there are so many) in this film.,736
Shadowlands,"A deeply personal and moving love story filled with many moments of beauty, joy and healing.",736
Sirens,It can be pleasant and distracting to watch but it ends up to be cutesy of all things.,737
Sirens,The surprise casting is not MacPherson but Sam Neill.,737
Sirens,A class act. Great performances.,737
Sirens,"Its eroticism -- good-natured, harmlessly naughty -- arises from character and material.",737
Sirens,"Aussie helmer Duigan seems committed to sensualist cinema: as a follow-up to Wide Sargasso Sea and Flirting, this comedy of morals and manners centers on a repressed preacher (Hugh Grant)and sexually wild spirits set against spectacular vistas.",737
Sirens,A congenial film about art and sex.,737
Sirens,"Dreary and pointless, even with all the supermodel nudity.",737
Sirens,It's hard to hate any art house film involving a buck naked Elle MacPherson.,737
Sirens,One of the most beautiful movies you're likely to see.,737
Sirens,It can be pleasant and distracting to watch but it ends up to be cutesy of all things.,737
Threesome,TriStar hopes that audiences' libidinous imaginations will keep their minds off the film's flaws.,738
Threesome,"The old saying goes, ""Two's company; three's a crowd."" It's an adage that would have served Threesome writer-director Andrew Fleming well.",738
Threesome,"The characters lack substance and development and, in the end, not only don't we care about them, but we'd sure like them to go away. Fast.",738
Threesome,"Fleming's vision may be less tony than the overrated Best Foreign Film, but it's truer. And a lot more fun.",738
Threesome,Mildly charming and occasionally sexy but shallow and silly menage at trois tale set at UCLA dormitory.,738
Threesome,The film is so proud of its alleged daring that it even begins with a dictionary definition of the word 'deviant.' 'Sitcom' would have been more like it.,738
Threesome,The movie often plays more like a wisecracking sitcom -- Saved by the Bell with four-letter words -- than a wise romantic roundelay.,738
Threesome,The three become a giggly and rather insufferable bunch.,738
Threesome,"The guy's parts were poorly written, especially the handsome, dumb jock type character (Stephen Baldwin).",738
Threesome,TriStar hopes that audiences' libidinous imaginations will keep their minds off the film's flaws.,738
Pretty Woman,This is a textbook example of how perfect casting can elevate a film beyond the limitations of its premise and plot.,739
Pretty Woman,"The impersonal direction is Garry Marshall's, whose work here amounts to a glistening mixture of sleaze and misogynist clichés.",739
Pretty Woman,It fits into the romance genre but it has some disgusting ideas to impart about what you can get out of a relationship and how men and women view each other. It’s misogynistic in its treatment of female characters who are not Ward...,739
Pretty Woman,"The intelligence and wit of this glass-slipper heart-of-gold fantasy are shocking too, but hell hath no part of the surprise.",739
Pretty Woman,"Pretty Woman is a fable, but Julia Roberts is fabulous. [Full review in Spanish]",739
Pretty Woman,Pretty Woman is just a bit of consumerist entertainment that is fun whilst it’s on the screen but leaves a very bad taste in your mouth afterwards.,739
Pretty Woman,...an exceedingly entertaining example of the romantic-comedy genre.,739
Pretty Woman,"""Pretty Woman"" is a story of second chances and the grace of getting elevated from a life of depravity to one of luxury and beauty-due, ultimately, to compassion.",739
Pretty Woman,"...steps away from all slapstick potential, and serves up a story that's finely balanced between male and female fantasy...",739
Pretty Woman,"An unequalled exercise in modern, mature romance, which would garner Roberts a Best Actress Academy Award nomination and a lengthy streak of box office stardom.",739
Jane Eyre,"An intelligent and considerate adaptation of the classic novel, conveying the emotional intensity and hidden attraction between the characters.",740
Jane Eyre,"This version of “Jane Eyre” is more of an exploration of old-school female empowerment and not letting a long string of defeats get the best of you. If anyone ever had multiple reasons to repeatedly throw in the towel and give up, it would be Jane.",740
Jane Eyre,"This is one of the best-looking, best-acted, and most involving adaptations of Brontë’s novel to date.",740
Jane Eyre,"The story is anchored by some wonderful performances, great costume and set design, and it’s moody yet captivating cinematography.",740
Jane Eyre,Jane Eyre scares and excites… a filmic miracle about survival. [Full review in Spanish],740
Jane Eyre,"My favorite version of Jane Eyre because it focuses the most on the romance and has such beautiful cinematography, music and performances",740
Jane Eyre,The film should only cement the growing reputation of Wasikowska.,740
Jane Eyre,This Jane Eyre adaptation far surpasses any of the previous film versions by benefiting from a master execution by director Cary Fukunaga. [Full review in Spanish],740
Jane Eyre,"The 18th film of Charlotte Bronte's chilly castle tale is a transcendently romantic, tragic, gothic ghost story from Cary Joji Fukunaga...",740
Jane Eyre,It really is hard to find a fault with this latest adaptation of Jane Eyre. It's certainly one of the most tonally stringent period films of recent years.,740
Ransom,"The movie, quite unavoidably, becomes ""Guys With Phones.""",742
Ransom,The result is a riveting 121 minute ride.,742
Ransom,The sheer plethora of silly plot holes and nonsensical moments does sort of ebb away at one's suspension of disbelief.,742
Ransom,"Ransom represents the rare breed of Hollywood thriller, combining crackerjack thrills with an intelligent, plausible, and dramatic script.",742
Ransom,A seriously stellar thriller...,742
Ransom,The special nature of this story is its many climaxes that border on false endings and also how Gibson's character responds to the ransom demand of $2 million.... it is Gibson who sells us on it and sells it well.,742
Ransom,"There are more climaxes in here than in a Swedish blue movie. This is not to say you won't be thrilled, charged up and put through the ringer at times, but your intelligence will need to be shoved under your seat like warm, flat soda.",742
Ransom,Howard directs for speed and force. The movie moves so quickly it yanks you by too many niggling doubts and the action scenes are so good that you wonder why Opie hasn't shown this much vicious pizazz before.,742
Ransom,"That's interesting stuff, but it doesn't play out with a lot of smarts. And the opportunity to end Ransom on a creepy note of unpredictability is forsaken for the usual glass-shattering, bullets-flying finale.",742
Ransom,"With a mechanical movie like this, filmmakers -- male or female -- can't take chances. Howard and company are hostages to their own conception.",742
"Crow: City of Angels, The","Visually, it’s still a stunning film, the soundtrack still rules, but the acting and cgi are not on point and they hurt the film as a whole.",743
"Crow: City of Angels, The","It's a story that never takes flight, while the constant ""cawing"" of an actual crow in nearly every scene only adds to the irritating experience.",743
"Crow: City of Angels, The",The most important thing you need to know about City of Angels is that it's the exact same movie as The Crow.,743
"Crow: City of Angels, The","A major portion of the film is reiteration, predominantly through repetitive flashbacks, which stretch out the overly simplistic revenge plot.",743
"Crow: City of Angels, The","Even for teens hooked on the grandiloquence of death-metal masochism, the movie may seem closer to an endless Sunday in church.",743
"Crow: City of Angels, The","Memo to Edward R. Pressman: Gloomy Goth teens like the Romeo and Juliet stuff, not parental devotion from beyond the grave.",743
"Crow: City of Angels, The",Stunningly awful.,743
"Crow: City of Angels, The","Although the setting has moved from Detroit to LA, the stylised urban wasteland, morbid atmosphere and basic plot remain the same.",743
"Crow: City of Angels, The","I highly recommend watching the original, instead of this dud.",743
"Crow: City of Angels, The","Vincent Perez is game, but he--nor anyone involved in this sloppy production--can erase the fond memories of the late Brandon Lee.",743
Michael Collins,"Jordan’s attention to detail and his ability to paint enemies and friends in differing, complex shades, exemplifies why his work as a director was frequently and criminally underrated.",744
Michael Collins,"Leaders who help bring about huge change are often gifted with a charisma that will spur a nation into action. Liam Neeson, as Irish revolutionary Michael Collins, has just that.",744
Michael Collins,The script and Neeson's passionate performance demonstrate a case where the good intention of heroes seeking freedom gets thwarted by political maneuverings.,744
Michael Collins,"Michael Collins really is Irish history told on a bold, sweeping, comprehensible scale; in a sense, it's almost Irish history Hollywoodised.",744
Michael Collins,"Clearly, this is a subject Jordan cares about passionately, but he hasn't found a form to make us share his passion. Unless you come to Michael Collins with strong feelings about its hero, it's unlikely you will be deeply engaged.",744
Michael Collins,"[Neeson] is superb as the principled, steely yet romantic action hero of Neil Jordan's film, which has been re-released for the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising in 1916.",744
Michael Collins,"Bad history perhaps, but Neeson's performance borders on the brilliant.",744
Michael Collins,"While the film is unflinching in its depiction of the brutality of both the English and the Irish, Jordan pointedly dissociates his hero from any actual ugliness.",744
Michael Collins,"There are pain and honor in [Neeson's] performance, and they constantly rise up to redeem a film that is less probing, less thoughtful than its director's claims and aspirations for it.",744
Michael Collins,"Intelligent, enormously accomplished and seriously problematic, Neil Jordan's ambitious account of the activities of arguably the central figure in Ireland's painful, bloody fight for independence from the British Empire has a great deal to offer...",744
"Ruling Class, The","The Ruling Class is that rarity, a successful, satiric film. No other genre is so plagued by good intentions and regrettable results.",745
"Ruling Class, The",In spots a very amusing and irreverent tongue-in-cheek satire on class that features a tour de force performance by Peter O'Toole.,745
"Ruling Class, The",The plot is convoluted but director Peter Medak makes some good satirical points about the British class system and Peter O'Toole is terrific in a well-deserved Oscar-nominated performance.,745
"Ruling Class, The","We get no real feeling that it knows where it's going, and every good comedy needs a certain headlong conviction.",745
"Ruling Class, The","If it's true that a people get the government they deserve, mightn't it be equally true that a people get the God they deserve?",745
"Ruling Class, The","A wonderful, wild ride. Peter O'Toole is outstanding.",745
"Ruling Class, The",decidedly postmodern several years before it became a buzzword,745
Real Genius,"The mid-’80s were big on teen-oriented sci-coms (scientific comedies), so you may have overlooked this gem with a great early performance by Val Kilmer.",746
Real Genius,"Not only does the film hold up fairly well, but the deeper aspects of the narrative become more obvious some 37 years since its release.",746
Real Genius,"Let’s face it, how can you go wrong with “Smart people on ice!” ?",746
Real Genius,...a mostly watchable yet lamentably erratic piece of work...,746
Real Genius,Real Genius is real dumb.,746
Real Genius,"Real Genius isn't just a showcase for a new talent. It's a well-paced, extremely likable film about a number of things that are being beaten to death in the movies these days. It dares to be both intelligent and funny. Shouldn't we all?",746
Real Genius,"Friends, the world is a wacky, wonderful tapestry of opinions and taste. However, there is one universal truth that I must insist we all acknowledge: Real Genius is the best movie of 1985. If you disagree, I'll see you in hell.",746
Real Genius,Real Genius shows that nerds have their own games. They don't need to run faster or get more pledges or give themselves makeovers to have fun and prove their worth.,746
Real Genius,"'80s college comedy with some sex jokes, cursing.",746
Real Genius,"Coolidge has gotten onto something here, and the pity is that the story she's stuck with never gets her any deeper into it.",746
Benny & Joon,"The film is blessed with a wonderful use of color and cinematography, stellar costume design and simple, but effective, set design.",747
Benny & Joon,Benny & Joon is a curious movie that should not work but somehow does.,747
Benny & Joon,"It is a funny, innocuous fable, a Sweet 'N Low romantic comedy that seems a little facile at first, but has irresistible charm.",747
Benny & Joon,"This film about love among the mentally ill is... as artificially sweet as a mouthful of saccharin. Still, it is irresistibly appealing in an old-fashioned, fantasy romance way.",747
Benny & Joon,"This sentimental stew is not without its flavors, and the cast tries hard to be winsome and adorably distraught.",747
Benny & Joon,"This is a wisp of a movie, to be sure, but underneath all the absurd comic fringes and the much-abused crazies-are-really-sane theme beats the heart of a genuinely poetic love story.",747
Benny & Joon,"If you're searching for something a little unconventional, Benny and Joon is sure to be a joy.",747
Benny & Joon,"Inconsequential as it is, Benny & Joon is that rare thing, a crazy-versus-sane movie that likes one kind as much as the other.",747
Benny & Joon,"There's something vaguely unsettling about ''Benny & Joon,'' a film that's billed innocuously as a ''charming, offbeat comedy'' that actually is about a woman suffering from mental illness.",747
Benny & Joon,"This fierce, smart jape gets you shaking with laughter, then leaves you simply shaking.",747
"Saint, The","In the end, there is too much here that we must take on faith.",748
"Saint, The","Many is the time that a potentially compelling biopic is ruined by an awful screenplay. ""Therese"" is ruined by many things.",748
"Saint, The","As fodder for a movie biography, her life plays out ploddingly, even with the occasional miracle thrown in.",748
"Saint, The",The very things that make Saint Therese of Lisieux's life spiritually compelling assure that it will not translate to film.,748
"Saint, The",Painfully sincere but hopelessly amateurish.,748
"Saint, The",Her mortal story seems one of sadness rather than inspiration.,748
"Saint, The","'A well-made, illuminating and moving depiction of one our most beloved saints.'",748
"Saint, The",This is the sort of movie parochial-school boys will want to draw moustaches on. They deserve our forgiveness.,748
"Saint, The",What lifts the film above mere proselytizing is the obvious sincerity of everyone involved in the project.,748
"Saint, The","When it comes to pious Catholicism, ""Therese"" makes ""The Passion of the Christ"" look like ""Cannibal Holocaust"".",748
"MatchMaker, The",Garofalo continues to be an appealing leading lady whose presence illuminates even pale films.,749
"MatchMaker, The",It simply isn't all that funny.,749
"MatchMaker, The","It's all very well-intentioned, but Garofalo mostly looks pained and uncomfortable as various touristy Irish village stereotypes unfold around her.",749
"MatchMaker, The","[Garofalo] glows when she smiles - that she gets cast in precariously winsome stuff like this fish-out-of-water romantic comedy set in a wee, twee Irish town.",749
"MatchMaker, The",[A]n innocuous hands-across-the-Atlantic brew that comes out flat from the spigot.,749
"MatchMaker, The","Billed as 'a romantic comedy for people who hate romantic comedies,' there's little here in this unremarkable film that's special enough to alter anyone's opinion.",749
"MatchMaker, The","By-the-book romantic comedy with great scenery, cute story, and engaging characters.",749
"MatchMaker, The",Surprising little romantic comedy that shows Garofalo could be a very charming movie actress if she wanted,749
"MatchMaker, The","There are two reasons to see ""The Matchmaker"" and neither involves the two characters at the center of this far-fetched romantic comedy.",749
"MatchMaker, The","Garofalo's good, but the Celtic charm is laid on way too thick.",749
Amistad,"Although flawed, this chilling movie further reveals Spielberg's skill as an expert film-maker unafraid of tackling heavy political",750
Amistad,"A much finer movie than Spielberg's sophomoric The Color Purple, it has power and dignity and it leads us into new places.",750
Amistad,"Whether or not Steven Spielberg is the right filmmaker for the job, Amistad tells an important story in not just American but world history.",750
Amistad,"Spielberg is a natural at portraying sickness, hunger, death and all horrible feelings that could be associated with slavery. His opening sequence easily blends the flickering lighting with the mutiny aboard La Amistad.",750
Amistad,Amistad is certainly a film of considerable power.,750
Amistad,"Amistad is worth seeing for the stormy scenes on board the slave boat, and for Djimon Hounsou's magnetic performance. Otherwise, it can't decide on its direction, and this unique historical event is stifled into a less than thrilling courtroom drama.",750
Amistad,The narrative perils are daunting in this little-known true tale of a bloody slave-ship rebellion in 1839 and its jumbled aftermath in the U.S. judicial system.,750
Amistad,"'Amistad' may not be the first, or fifth, or tenth film people talk about when Spielberg's name comes up. But it has more moments that will put your hair on end than other filmmakers' best works, and that says something.",750
Amistad,Powerful story for mid-teens and up.,750
Amistad,"In short, a wordy courtroom drama which seldom progresses beyond ciphers, stereotypes and salutary slogans.",750
Tomorrow Never Dies,Michelle Yeoh is our all-time favorite Bond girl.,751
Tomorrow Never Dies,Tomorrow Never Dies brings non-stop action and thrills in a fun installment of the James Bond franchise.,751
Tomorrow Never Dies,"The series has reached the point where a Bond film’s simplest, most satisfying moment comes when good old Q breaks out his cool gadgets.",751
Tomorrow Never Dies,"Where it is commonly thought that the franchise had it's over the top goofy villains in the 70s, it turns out that the 90s would provide us with easily one of the most cartoonish villains of the franchise.",751
Tomorrow Never Dies,Tomorrow Never Dies manages what always seemed impossible: It makes a Bond movie boring.,751
Tomorrow Never Dies,"Tomorrow Never Die has its moments, but the film ultimately suffers from a lack of imagination, hastily going through the Bond motions without ever leaving much of an impact.",751
Tomorrow Never Dies,"The action sequences are routinely stupendous, even if the storyline is enormously unmemorable.",751
Tomorrow Never Dies,How do you top Goldeneye? Unfortunately not with this effort.,751
Tomorrow Never Dies,"Tomorrow Never Dies falls more towards the average thanks to a thin plot and an entertaining but extremely plain villain. Not bad, not great, just... fine.",751
Tomorrow Never Dies,It's really just a techno-action movie (and a crap one at that) paying lipservice to the conventions of the Bond movie.,751
"Replacement Killers, The","This film might be the ultimate temp job, but stars Chow Yin-Fat and Mira Sorvino deserve better work.",752
"Replacement Killers, The","It isn't boring, but it could have amounted to a lot more, particularly as the final showdown is thrillingly chaotic and brutal.",752
"Replacement Killers, The","As for the plot here, let's just say it has something to do with hit men, drug lords and revenge, and leave it at that.",752
"Replacement Killers, The","People with particularly indiscriminate taste in action cinema will enjoy The Replacement Killers on its own merits, and Chow and Sorvino fans will take away some enjoyment from watching them perform together",752
"Replacement Killers, The","...it's ultimately impossible not to wonder what Chow, making his English-language debut here, was thinking when he signed up for the project.",752
"Replacement Killers, The",The John Woo school of the ballet of bullets gets a full dose of Sam Peckinpah under the steady hand of director Antoine Fuqua's finely framed tale of revenge.,752
"Replacement Killers, The",An unworthy vehicle for a great star like Chow Yun-fat.,752
"Replacement Killers, The","The Replacement Killers is not a very good film, but it is impossible to deny that it has a certain beauty.",752
"Replacement Killers, The",Will serve as a suitable replacement when [Chow Yun Fat's] better films are already rented out for the weekend.,752
"Replacement Killers, The","Style over substance all the way, but at least it's not boring.",752
Burnt By the Sun,"In its emotional involvement, it reaches a rare cinematic level of tragic grandeur.",753
Burnt By the Sun,"Deep, historically revealing, unforgettable.",753
Burnt By the Sun,"There's a touch of Chekhovian poetic realism in Mikhalkov's mesmerizingly beautiful chronicle of love, family, and the intrusion of politics, which won the 1994 best foreign-language Oscar.",753
Burnt By the Sun,Brilliant allegory about retired Russian officer who discovers he can't escape Stalin's purges.,753
Burnt By the Sun,"Overbearing and, unsurprisingly, mostly forgotten.",753
Burnt By the Sun,"I generally don't like slapstick comedy, and this movie was no exception.",753
Burnt By the Sun,"A brilliant, Chekhovian meditation on trust, love, and the intrusive horrors that period of time brought to otherwise normal families.",753
Burnt By the Sun,"Burnt by the Sun was not the best of the nominated foreign films (Before the Rain deserved to win), and is not even very original.",753
Burnt By the Sun,"Though my foreign Oscar pick would still have been Eat Drink Man Woman, Sun is such a personal close second that I can go with the academy novelty of novelties.",753
Red Corner,Unconvincing courtroom thriller.,754
Red Corner,"O roteiro mostra uma incompetncia to grande ao tratar da histria, que realmente surpreendente que ele tenha sido vendido a algum.",754
Red Corner,"So unrealistic, so contrived and so blatantly ""Hollywood"" that Gere can't possibly imagine he's opening any eyes to the problem, or any doors to its solution, for that matter.",754
Red Corner,"Everything ... is dominated by actress Bai Ling, who creates a full-blooded character and role model for young girls.",754
Red Corner,"Red Corner is a contrived and cumbersome thriller designed to showcase Richard Gere's unhappiness with Red China, which it does with such thoroughness that story and characters are enveloped in the gloom.",754

Jumanji,"Even with a simple plot, Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle is so flat-out hysterical that it’s a complete joy to watch. The film embraces the silly concept of being sucked into a video game, but never insults the audience’s intelligence.",755
Jumanji,Dwayne Johnson is a jungle VIP in this entertaining sequel to the much-loved Robin Williams caper.,755
Jumanji,Viewers and gamers alike may have more fun with Pitfall Harry.,755
Jumanji,"It's dumb fun, in some cases very dumb fun, but it made me laugh.",755
Jumanji,We defy you not to laugh every time The Rock lets loose his eyebrow-tastic signature look. Robin Williams would have been proud.,755
Jumanji,By the time the end credits roll everyone are better off than when the movie started... except maybe the audience who deserve more than a handful of laughs and warmed over 90s nostalgia.,755
Jumanji,"Back and forth banter is largely amusing, even if the script insists upon containing wholesome themes.",755
Jumanji,"A spunky ball of energetic entertainment, with a whole lot of fun and heartwarming moments.",755
Jumanji,"You might not have thought you needed another Jumanji movie, but once you see it, it might be difficult to imagine ever not wanting it to exist.",755
Jumanji,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a harmless, well-meaning, spirited, and perhaps overly polished adventure tale that I can almost guarantee you kids of a certain age will really take to.",755
Father of the Bride Part II,Anyone looking forward to a second dose of the first film's frothy bittersweet fun can forget it. This is frighteningly bad.,756
Father of the Bride Part II,...benefits rather substantially from the winning work of its various players...,756
Father of the Bride Part II,Mark this as a likable and comforting version of the American family.,756
Father of the Bride Part II,I like the sequel as well as the original,756
Father of the Bride Part II,"Like a trained monkey, Martin Short is trotted back out for more of his mincing shtick. But perhaps the most unattractive quality of both films is the ugly obsession with material excess.",756
Father of the Bride Part II,The strengths of these films are not so much laughs as sincerity and heart. [Blu-ray],756
Father of the Bride Part II,A sequel to a lousy remake? How droll.,756
Father of the Bride Part II,A follow up as emotional as the original,756
Father of the Bride Part II,More of a sequel for sequel's sake than a justified continuation of the story.,756
Father of the Bride Part II,An exuberant sequel to complete a near-perfect translation of the 1950s era comedies to the 1990s.,756
Across the Sea of Time,Presents a vivid and dramatic portrait of New York past and present. It will enchant and enthrall New Yorkers and tourists alike,757
Across the Sea of Time,"For those willing to forgive the loose history and storytelling here, the rewards are 3-D views of Manhattan that blossom on the screen and occasionally stun.",757
Across the Sea of Time,"Employing 3-D and PSE sound, then projected on a screen that suggests a small skyscraper, the new show at West Side Manhattan's Sony IMAX theater is, visually speaking, nothing but a clear day... but it definitely put me in scat-mode.",757
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,"…oddball yet ridiculously prescient, this uncannily accurate vision of the future was laughed out of cinemas in 1995, but seen from 2024, got absolutely tonnes right when it comes to the detail of how we live now…",758
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,"By the film's end, there's a crisis with a time limit. But seldom has a countdown meant so little.",758
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,"No one is going to see Lawnmower Man 2 for the acting, however; the film rises or falls on its special effects...",758
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,"Mowing the lawn might be more involving than watching this subpar sci-fi sequel, which manages to be complicated and witless at the same time.",758
Fair Game,"The viewer exits the film troubled, but not outraged—which is how we should feel after learning about our government lying to us.",759
Fair Game,Fine performances from both Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.,759
Fair Game,"English-born, Aussie-raised Naomi Watts hits all the right American-accented notes...",759
Fair Game,"Thanks to the eyes of [Doug] Liman's lens and powerful performances by [Naomi] Watts and [Sean] Penn, with Fair Game we are given truth amidst psychological political intrigue. An undeniable winning combination.",759
Fair Game,"Director Doug Liman does a good job of letting the story speak for itself, sparing the audience from too much soap-boxing. Watts and Penn are both solid, although Penn's performance does border on over-the-top in a couple of key scenes.",759
Fair Game,"Fair Game was in no way a terrible movie, but with a scattered storyline and somewhat caricature-like performances by both leads, it failed to connect as it should have.",759
Fair Game,"Fair Game is smart, beautifully-acted, and unapologetic.",759
Fair Game,"It should be gripping stuff, but Liman combines too much information with too much pontificating to create an uneasy blend of slow-paced political thriller and family drama.",759
Fair Game,Naomi Watt delivers but the script offers a lifeless story and too many one-dimensional characters to name.,759
Fair Game,"If the filmmakers had skimmed off some of the exposition from the first half, and tightened it up in order to get to the main part of the story faster, it would have worked a lot better.",759
Screamers,"Plenty of good (albeit derivative) ideas and evident potential clash with contrived concepts, inconsistent pacing, and last-minute designs.",760
Screamers,"The cheap B-movie version of better sci-fi movies, with a few things about it to like and a lot of things you just have to tolerate",760
Screamers,The ensuing Darwinian struggle combines space opera skirmishes and Cold War paranoia - although the characters' dialogue involves the kind of tough guy/gal posturing overfamiliar from the sort of '80s action movie this was in fact supposed to be.,760
Screamers,Director Christian Duguay kicks Screamers off with a comically dense information scroll that immediately establishes an atmosphere of confusion...,760
Screamers,Screamers manages to evolve and entertain throughout.,760
Screamers,Plodding treatment of an interesting storyline.,760
Screamers,"Based on a short story by the great nutball sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, Screamers is more like a high-pitched rip-off of Alien.",760
Screamers,"A fun, fast-paced futuristic thriller with enough jolts per frame to keep even the most impatient action fan happy.",760
Screamers,"The design and effects teams have lent scale and impact to the futuristic locations and sets. If only Duguay's flashy, aimless direction had succeeded in filling these barren wastes and antiseptic interiors with something resembling human life.",760
Screamers,"Until it succumbs to one cliche too many, Screamers, which was directed by Christian Duguay, does an efficient job of generating a stomach-knotting tension.",760
Nick of Time,Another bummer from John Badham.,761
Nick of Time,"If the director's emotions aren't real, aren't engaged by the story, then his characters' emotions won't be real either.",761
Nick of Time,"Fair enough if the film isn't going to be a cerebral treatment of its real-time hook, but, for the most part, it fails in its more simple and pulpy remit to thrill.",761
Nick of Time,"'90s action-thriller has intense peril, cursing, violence.",761
Nick of Time,...a solid thriller that neatly and efficiently gets the job done...,761
Nick of Time,"O artifcio narrativo do ""tempo real"", usado com bem mais eficcia em Matar ou Morrer e Festim Diablico, acaba se revelando insuficiente para gerar a tenso desejada, que, como se no bastasse, destruda de vez no terrvel ato final do filme.",761
Nick of Time,An exciting albeit illogical tale of mystery and suspense...,761
Nick of Time,A fast and furious 90 minutes that doesn't waste a second.,761
Nick of Time,"A slick, highly imaginative thriller",761
Nick of Time,Depp... is very visibly bored with this blatant bid for mainstream action stardom.,761
Beautiful Girls,The 1996 dramedy shows how woke guardrails cripple Hollywood screenwriters.,762
Beautiful Girls,"Consistently smart and funny — sharply written and well-acted, with an authentic Bay State fatalism underlying every scene.",762
Beautiful Girls,"Beautiful Girls would have us believe being a guy is hard, confusing, nay, downright torturous.",762
Beautiful Girls,"...the kind of salty, self-aware movie that nobody seems to make these days...",762
Beautiful Girls,"Does ""Beautiful Girls"" philosophically aspire to much more than mirroring a Counting Crows lyric from ""Mr. Jones?"" Maybe not. But there's a barroom eloquence, bottle-bottomed anxiety and stumblebum sadness to it that lingers in its bones.",762
Beautiful Girls,"This film really succeeds with its warm treatment of ordinary hang-ups -- no life-shattering revelations or pain repressed since childhood, just the genuine, everyday trials of life.",762
Beautiful Girls,Beautiful Girls is always in touch with reality but never drowned in it.,762
Beautiful Girls,"Natalie Portman, as a 13-year-old on whom Hutton develops a strangely affecting crush, is a delight.",762
Beautiful Girls,"Demme's conversational film is about the gaping chasm between what men say and what they feel. It may not tell us anything new, but its eloquence is quietly rewarding.",762
Beautiful Girls,Natalie Portman steals all the scenes with Timothy Hutton and lights up the movie...,762
Happy Gilmore,Sports comedies can be a tricky genre to pull off but Happy Gilmore manages to hit it in the hole more often than not.,763
Happy Gilmore,...holds up impressively well all these years later.,763
Happy Gilmore,[Adam] Sandler vascillates between obnoxiousness and boyish charm and winds up winning plenty -- including the majority of audience members -- in the end.,763
Happy Gilmore,"The comedy is never more than sudden, outsized explosions of violence from the otherwise placid, childlike Happy. But director Dugan maximizes the laughs through careful timing and counterpoint.",763
Happy Gilmore,there's still plenty of true immaturity to go around,763
Happy Gilmore,Adolescent humor at its best/worst. Lots of profanity.,763
Happy Gilmore,[A] one-joke Caddyshack for the blitzed and jaded.,763
Happy Gilmore,"Sandler's serious moments are dramatically deadly, while a little of his comedy goes a long way.",763
Happy Gilmore,"There are about three minutes of funny material in Happy Gilmore, and pretty much all of them are in the trailer.",763
Happy Gilmore,"Fans of sport and brash, boisterous comedies will find a lot to love here.",763
If Lucy Fell,"A bleak, annoyingly quirky Gen-X recasting of the When Harry Met Sally notion that true love is based on friendship.",764
If Lucy Fell,These writer-director-actors seem to want to make movies just so they can be cuddly in them.,764
If Lucy Fell,I just don't find this to be an appealling or believable film.,764
If Lucy Fell,Romantic comedy about loving the one in your heart instead of the one in your fantasies.,764
If Lucy Fell,"Schaeffer is the one who fells Lucy by casting himself in the male lead, then failing to convince anyone that either female lead could be attracted to his character.",764
If Lucy Fell,"If Lucy Fell has all the attributes of romantic comedy, including absolute predictability. The only surprise is that it also provides a mostly-enjoyable journey to its ultimate destination.",764
If Lucy Fell,"It's airy, fluffy and ultimately uninteresting.",764
If Lucy Fell,"Sadly, the story is nowhere as original as the details and performances.",764
If Lucy Fell,"Schaeffer trips up, though, when he lets his philosophies get the better of him.",764
If Lucy Fell,"All coy grins and daffy mugging, Mr. Stiller plays the role as if aspiring to become the Elliott Gould of his generation. Compared with jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge, that's a reasonable goal.",764
Boomerang,"A fiercely underrated romantic comedy that established Murphy as not only a generational comedic actor but a suave leading man in the genre, Boomerang felt a bit ahead of its time.",765
Boomerang,Riotously funny Eddie Murphy comedy is rife with complicated sexual politics and dated ethnic jokes in a confused script that wants it both ways. Great Reginald Hudlin commentary on this new blu-ray from Paramount Home Entertainment.,765
Boomerang,Only sporadically amusing.,765
Boomerang,Boomerang was not a good film in 1992 when it came out and definitely has not aged well. Plenty of the jokes and dialogue are offensive to today’s ears.,765
Boomerang,"Murphy is strong as the lothario brought to his knees, but he also flexes his range.",765
Boomerang,Boomerang is classic Murphy with an ensemble cast full of talented actors.,765
Boomerang,Boomerang ought to be in the conversation when discussing classic romantic comedies because this film is underrated.,765
Boomerang,"Gross, no fun.",765
Boomerang,"It's a basic story, but at the same time, this is an all-Black story.",765
Boomerang,"I enjoyed it. It was a half hour too long...but I thought it was funny, charming, and it reminded me how much I like Eddie Murphy.",765
Man of the Year,Man of the Year had the potential to be one of the all-time comedy masterpieces had it not shifted tones during the film's second hour.,766
Man of the Year,"Barry Levinson's Man of the Year is a negligible and insipid film. If one takes a storyline ""from the headlines,"" one should do it with some depth or not bother at all.",766
Man of the Year,A mess of incongruous ideas that even Williams can't redeem or effectively rib.,766
Man of the Year,Impeach this one already.,766
Man of the Year,Doesn't get my vote.,766
Man of the Year,Lame political comedy misses the mark.,766
Man of the Year,"Uneven, but never less than entertaining.",766
Man of the Year,"Man of the Year has some nice ideas and a handful of excellent scenes, but it struggles to find the right tone and is hamstrung by a ridiculous plot point.",766
Man of the Year,"Too compromised to be more than a reasonably pleasurable entertainment, as if it is scared about what it is saying about the American political process.",766
Man of the Year,"This being Robin Williams, it's hard to find his routines as vote-winningly hilarious as they're meant to be.",766
Casper,"Casper is a deeply tragic yet oddly wholesome coming-of-age tale about loneliness and grief. Though the film is essentially a meditation on death, it isn’t all doom and gloom. It still has its zany moments and mid-90s charm.",768
Casper,"More like a Cinderella story than a gothic horror, this really was one of the most under-rated movies of the 1990s and should keep viewers of all ages engrossed on a slow summer holiday day.",768
Casper,"...an erratic but generally passable adaptation that could've easily been much, much worse.",768
Casper,This movie was so important to me,768
Casper,It's a perfect kids movie,768
Casper,"All these years later, Casper has managed to stick around thanks to it offering a pleasant blend of what audiences expect from a kids movie and some weightier thematic fare.",768
Casper,It's a funny and often poignant film that's worth reexamining today.,768
Casper,Never cloying or abundant with cutesy dialogue...,768
Casper,Haunted house tale not as mild as the cartoons.,768
Casper,"Only Ricci, strange gothic child that she is, gets close to shining next to the animation.",768
Congo,This is ridiculously entertaining. However it's also a complete mess with wild action set pieces and performances.,769
Congo,"This is one of my favorite messiest films ever. Between Tim Curry's unhinged performance, the insane relationship between Amy and Peter, and Laura Linney being a badass, what's not to love about this?? They don't make wild movies like this anymore.",769
Congo,...the first major mistake in a summer that has already netted several commercial blockbusters.,769
Congo,"A great-looking, but ultimately meaningless slab of escapism.",769
Congo,"It's riddled with faults, but it's still watchable in rare parts - if only for the infrequency in which nature-gone-amuck creature-features come to theaters.",769
Congo,Congo falls short on its cinematic impact.,769
Congo,"It's a shocker: clunkingly written, dismally acted, haphazardly directed, and with some of the most glaringly conspicuous sound-stages masquerading as the African jungle ever seen in a major American movie.",769
Congo,The lackluster adventure film misses out on most of the thrills from the Michael Crichton 1980 bestseller.,769
Congo,"A goofy mess whose screws aren't loose, but missing entirely.",769
Congo,"I love it because it's good, and yet so bad it's good.",769
Devil in a Blue Dress,"The story unfolds slowly, but it's a script that will hook you from the start.",770
Devil in a Blue Dress,Carl Franklin’s neo-noir is hard-boiled and filled with moods of disillusionment in Los Angeles...,770
Devil in a Blue Dress,"Denzel Washington’s voiceover in neo-noir Devil in a Blue Dress is an equal mix of deadpan charm and wide-eyed innocence, which textures and nuances his performance.",770
Devil in a Blue Dress,As “Devil in a Blue Dress” maneuvers its way through its taut and savvy mystery I found myself glued to its every twist and turn.,770
Devil in a Blue Dress,"I’ve long been a champion of this film, as it’s precisely the kind of push forward I like to see in a studio film. Taking old conventions and finding ways to update them is what to do when so much talent is available to accomplish something special.",770
Devil in a Blue Dress,"Don Cheadle steals the show whenever he is on the screen. The plot is intricate and well written, but Moseley needs to broaden his images of women.",770
Devil in a Blue Dress,I will not unravel the story for you because that is half the fun of watching this kind of movie. Go see it.,770
Devil in a Blue Dress,"In Devil, folks like Easy Rawlins have long since learned to roll with the racial punches. It's precisely that kind of offhand profundity that makes the movie so memorable. Franklin's picture is effortlessly wise beneath its entertaining surface.",770
Devil in a Blue Dress,"Thanks to screenwriter and director Carl Franklin, Devil has blossomed into a compulsively watchable mystery, a redolently atmospheric period piece, and a provocative meditation on race, ambition and civics.",770
Devil in a Blue Dress,"It is a smart, sly film imbued with the rich subtle tones of a mournful blues saxophone piece, worthy of comparisons to some of the best noir films of decades past.",770
Johnny Mnemonic,"There are several major problems with Johnny Mnemonic, and the fact that these problems are each overlayed on top of each other serves to compound the film’s faults",771
Johnny Mnemonic,Campy yet cerebral...,771
Johnny Mnemonic,"Johnny Mnemonic is both terrible and brilliant, in equal measure.",771
Johnny Mnemonic,"As a whole piece, the movie just clicks. It's sprawling and silly and has no right to work at all, but it somehow just does.",771
Johnny Mnemonic,Johnny Mnemonics journey from zero to hero is more prescient than ever in 2022,771
Johnny Mnemonic,"It poignantly juxtaposes its futurism with a yearning for the past, in the form of Johnny's abandoned memories. As for Reeves, he is always best when he is calm and frowningly subdued...",771
Johnny Mnemonic,Reeves leads an international cast of tax breaks in this chintzy cyberpunk thriller.,771
Johnny Mnemonic,It clearly has a difficult time creating an identity more memorable than the various individual pieces that would be reused in subsequent pictures.,771
Johnny Mnemonic,Johnny Mnemonic is no The Matrix; its world-building lacks specifically nuanced grit. But the ideas Gibson thrust forward furthered the cyberpunk conversation onscreen for years to come.,771
Johnny Mnemonic,"Its a shame that the whole design is so tacky, the realization so simple, devoid of resources and imagination, and that is impossible to highlight anything good about the cast. [Full Review in Spanish]",771
Kids,"This savagely controversial, deeply brutal movie, the debut of many notable talents, was notorious in its day and still is. 'Kids' is definitely not for ""kids,"" but it's an unsettlingly effective cautionary tale.",772
Kids,"[Kids'] rough, in-your-face approach to exposing the perils of teenage promiscuity teaches a harsh lesson.",772
Kids,"The film's lack of thesis and use of realistic sex/rape scenes provides no medicine to the wound it gives the viewers, offering nothing interesting to declare about the problems it presents to us. Instead it only sticks the knife in deeper.",772
Kids,The parallel seductions serve to show the audience that male sexuality is predatory and female sexuality is passive and victim-based.,772
Kids,"In the end, Kids is bound to enrage some viewers, enthrall others and confound most (even among those very teens who aren't allowed in because of the film's non-rated release to avoid the dreaded NC-17).",772
Kids,"Kids is stunningly anti-erotic, though not untainted by sensationalism. By condensing all this inflammatory material into a 24-hour time frame, Clark and Harmony Korine create an overwrought narrative that's sometimes tedious in its relentlesshess.",772
Kids,"Exploitative, gross, and despicable...",772
Kids,"There really are some kids who think like this, and these are the kids who should see this film",772
Kids,"Pedophilia, pedophilia, pedophilia.",772
Kids,"The first-time director, Larry Clark, is rather like his protagonist: He comes on to you, has his rough way with you, and leaves you feeling empty and violated.",772
Mute Witness,"Anthony Waller's film is a huge surprise: fast-paced, well-shot, and featuring a great mix of comedy and thrills.",773
Mute Witness,"... the writing here is solid and creates a film that has actually surprising moments, makes an effort to be thrilling while being a bit less scary than other films of its ilk.",773
Mute Witness,"Mute Witness may have a somewhat simple premise, but using that as a foundation, it's able to derive plenty of thrills, chills, and even a few laughs, ultimately turning this into an effective '90s crime thriller that does quite a lot with so little.",773
Mute Witness,It's possibly the best film in the history of UK-Russian-German co-productions. Ideal for a Halloween night. [Full review in Spanish],773
Mute Witness,A mute woman as protagonist here is a commentary on all the ways in which women who come forward with stories of violence are disbelieved or outright silenced.,773
Mute Witness,"Mute Witness grips us from the start, and never lets up.",773
Mute Witness,"It feels like Waller poured all the inspiration he ever had into one movie. But for a film forged through a favor and trial-by-fire moviemaking, it earns its place in the panoply of '90s psychological thrillers that throw you for a loop or six.",773
Mute Witness,"Waller's witty, well-crafted yet unpretentious thriller--about American youths who make a movie in Moscow and get involved with the underworld--is a seductive piece of filmmaking that should keep viewers hyperventilating to the last reel.",773
Mute Witness,Great suspense thriller.,773
Mute Witness,"Once you see it, you'll have an enthusiastic new response when people ask you ""Hmm, what's a good horror movie I've never seen?""",773
"Prophecy, The",The Prophecy is blessed with a remarkable cast.,774
"Prophecy, The","It had great potential, but turned too ridiculous for comfort.",774
"Prophecy, The","Surprisingly, the appearance of perennial film weirdo Walken in slicked-back raven hair actually marks the point where The Prophecy begins to slow down and deteriorate.",774
"Prophecy, The","I like to think that Walken flipped through the script, realized how lame it was, and decided to have some fun anyway.",774
"Prophecy, The","Angels battling on earth, a hammy Walken; church is more interesting.",774
"Prophecy, The",Christopher Walken is a wonderful thing.,774
"Prophecy, The","It looked a lot fresher when it was new, but it's still intriguing.",774
"Prophecy, The",Top-notch combination of Supernatural thrills and Walken-esque sensation,774
"Prophecy, The",Chris Walken is worth the price of admission,774
"Prophecy, The","Paradise Lost reimagined as a droll B horror picture. Walken is terrific, as always, and Viggo Mortensen's cameo is worth the price of admission alone.",774
Something to Talk About,"Contains the occasional barb -- mainly from Kyra Sedgwick, who steals the film as Roberts' tart-tongued sister. But Roberts herself is a drip, and it's a dull story.",775
Something to Talk About,"The film, though not unentertaining, keeps on backtracking, sentimentalising and not quite getting to grips with its subject matter.",775
Something to Talk About,"Unfortunately, with the exception of Sedgwick's spirited monopoly on one-liners, all this happens not only with unrelating meandering mundanity and a drab performance from Roberts, but also with the addition of a [pointless] subplot.",775
Something to Talk About,You'll be talking about this film all right when you come out -- about how numbingly dreadful it is.,775
Something to Talk About,"[Julia Roberts and Gena Rowlands] are treated disgracefully by the men in their lives, yet they still seem curiously forgiving. Mind you, it is set in the Deep South, which always appears stuck in a time warp.",775
Something to Talk About,"The humanity is spread around with a quirky, generous hand, reason enough to distinguish this quiet, low-tech comedy in a season of big-bang juvenilia.",775
Something to Talk About,A few stray moments of wit mired amidst a low-key and sleep-inducing presentation.,775
Something to Talk About,"Dull, dumb and listless.",775
Something to Talk About,"Horrible ""romantic comedy."" Great message for the ladies: Forgive your cheating husband because that's the best you can do.",775
Something to Talk About,Focuses on the personal renewal of a woman after the break-up of her marriage.,775
Three Wishes,The scenery is another protagonist in the classic tale in this adventure for the entire family. [Full review in Spanish],776
Three Wishes,[Astrid S.] interprets with ease and charisma a Cinderella that's much more than a man's object of affection... [Full review in Spanish],776
Three Wishes,"So, again, mileage will vary, because for some viewers, this is merely a clean, simple telling of a cute story. For others, however, the tale of Cinderella is one of exclusion, sexism, and abuse.",776
Three Wishes,It's easy to get swept up in this oft-told but pleasant tale.,776
Castle Freak,The overall narrative might not be groundbreaking but the confidence in the absurdity and the provocative nature of the direction makes for a weird and wild experience.,777
Castle Freak,"A slim tale of redemption and survival, with excitable acting that practically transforms the effort into 3-D, but the macabre essentials are provided with skill by the helmer.",777
Castle Freak,Not as freaky as it sounds.,777
Castle Freak,"Rarely do you see a film that combines graphic sex and cannibal gore to such grisly effect, and that may be a good thing, but it's important to praise a movie for what it gets right.",777
Castle Freak,"Very, very disappointing Stuart Gordon effort",777
Don Juan DeMarco,"Mr. Brando is now a picturesque ruin, but he is just as magnetic as of old.",778
Don Juan DeMarco,"Ultimately, the inspiration that underlies the whole film is the magic of discovering the sublime in the superficial by dedicating one's life to living perfectly in the moment.",778
Don Juan DeMarco,"Before you start clutching this newspaper and panting, be aware that I am writing here about a comedy - a very rare comedy, that dares to play itself seriously and to take unusual risks.",778
Don Juan DeMarco,"The film has its slow patches, and its fragile illusion probably doesn't stand up to close scrutiny. But, mostly, it dances on a very fine knife's edge between charm and absurdity, an irresistible paean to the art of kiss-kiss.",778
Don Juan DeMarco,"Clearly, director-writer Jeremy Leven was too intimidated by the great Brando to insist that he enunciate. Too bad. But then, Leven didn't do his job well either.",778
Don Juan DeMarco,"The movie itself is never as good as it should be, owing to Leven's lifeless staging.",778
Don Juan DeMarco,"For the film to work, we'd have to be in denial... and it's just not magical enough for that.",778
Don Juan DeMarco,"Cushy it might be in appearance, but it is also pretty flat.",778
Don Juan DeMarco,"Brando doesn't so much walk through this movie as coast, in a gassy, self-indulgent performance no one else could have gotten away with.",778
Don Juan DeMarco,"The movie, written and directed by Jeremy Leven, may not be one for the ages, but it's a pleasant, involving experience that intermixes fairy-tale romance with modern, deadpan comedy.",778
Drop Zone,"Nothing in the real world, though, will get you to tense up over ``Drop Zone.'' It is strictly a spectator sport...",779
Drop Zone,It's a far-from-innovative premise that's employed to familiar yet consistently watchable effect by filmmaker John Badham...,779
Drop Zone,It's the most convincing and well-staged skydiving film ever.,779
Drop Zone,Good cheesy fun. One of Snipes' best.,779
Drop Zone,Reasonably exciting.,779

Drop Zone,It's the most convincing and well-staged skydiving film ever.,779
Dumb & Dumber,It isn’t nonstop hilarity; there are quite a few dead spots. But I liked it a lot.,780
Dumb & Dumber,The teaming and the formula are often copied but rarely matched.,780
Dumb & Dumber,"What makes this fantasy of anti-social behaviour so painfully funny, is the gulf between etiquette and vulgarity, the desire to be a child whooping it up in the adult world.",780

Dumb & Dumber,...a modern classic of the comedy genre...,780
Dumb & Dumber,"The plot, of course, is merely an excuse for an endless series of gags, and the percentage of them that score is fairly high.",780
Dumb & Dumber,"From the puns to the slapstick to the toilet, Dumb and Dumber is performed at such a high level that it transcends many of its influences.",780
Dumb & Dumber,Easily one of the funniest (and most quotable) movies ever made...,780
Dumb & Dumber,"The caviar of low-brow, gross-out comedy.",780
Dumb & Dumber,"The Farrellys' knack for stupid, Three Stooges-esque comedy writ larger by an infusion of heart excels with the complementary screen teaming of manic Jim Carrey and consummate screen actor Jeff Daniels. [Blu-ray]",780

Little Odessa,Little Odessa is the kind of tragedy where the father always forgets the syrup.,782
Little Odessa,The film has no plot. The audience never knows why the murders take place and soon ceases to care.,782
Little Odessa,"This dark, brooding family melodrama, set against the context of Brooklyn's Russian-Jewish mob, is well acted by Tim Roth, Maximillian Schell, Vanessa Redgrave, and Edward Furlong.",782
Little Odessa,"Desperately trying to say something complex, it only manages to look as if it said something that mattered.",782
Little Odessa,"[Little Odessa] is neither a family drama nor a crime melodrama, but a series of disconnected scenes that play like exercises -- some of them very good ones.",782
Milk Money,An infantile and sad sex-comedy that should go straight to video release.,783
Milk Money,"It's difficult to dislike the fun-loving sexuality and adventure, even if it runs on about half-an-hour too long and resolves the predicaments too easily.",783
Milk Money,"It exists largely so the film could be sold as a spicy romantic comedy that you could still show to your grandmother, if your grandmother had no taste.",783
Milk Money,A deeply strange little movie...,783
Milk Money,"A silly, offensive movie.",783
Milk Money,Frank '90s comedy about boys befriending a prostitute.,783
Milk Money,"What results is, at best, only a sparingly funny series of mistaken identities and some really distasteful hooker gags delivered by the shocked townsfolk.",783
Milk Money,The latest film from director Richard Benjamin is a sour little attempt at heartwarming comedy that blithely relies on that most questionable and discomforting film convention -- the prostitute with a heart of gold.,783
Milk Money,Only the least demanding audiences can be expected to buy into Milk Money.,783
Milk Money,A work so rancid and alienating you can only suppose it was planned as a tax loss.,783
Beyond Bedlam,"Not my cup of blood, at all, but censorship or scandal only publicises work of little merit. My suggestion: forget the whole thing.",784
Beyond Bedlam,"Jean doesn't altogether disappoint with this second offering -- not as a director. Beyond Bedlam is handsomely mounted, with a flair for framing, camera movement and expressionist lighting.",784
Only You,"Sweet, but cavity-inducing. And it's hardly enough to make us believe the blank-faced Downey as a romantic lead.",785
Only You,...an appealingly romantic premise that's employed to rather hit-and-miss effect by Jewison...,785
Only You,"It's only ostensibly about men; the real focus is on the friendship between two women, as well as the ways in which their support system helps them get past tribulations.",785
Only You,"Moonstruck director Norman Jewison successfully mines the same territory with this delicious ""Cinderella Italian-style"" romantic comedy.",785
Only You,"Hunt plays the Eve Arden role of Tomei's wisecracking pal to perfection, making her the single best reason to see the movie.",785
Only You,"""Only You"" plays more like a pleasant travelogue than an involving film.",785
Only You,"[D]espite the lovely Italian locales and a relatively appealing cast, the film is far too cloying for all but the most sentimental tastes.",785
Only You,"If it seems implausible that a young woman on a teacher's salary would be able to sport designer clothes and stay in posh pensiones all over Italy, well, who is a reviewer to quibble with ``destino''?",785
Only You,"Movies like Only You and its obvious model, Sleepless in Seattle, are less true romances than they are collections of romantic signifiers.",785
Only You,"Jewison knows exactly where the laugh and welling-up buttons are that will hook the audience into this middle-class fairy-tale-come-true, and has smartly cast it with engaging personalities.",785
"Perez Family, The",These failures of taste are even more unfortunate because Nair and her cinematographer (Stuart Dryburgh of The Piano) have created a striking visual universe...,786
"Perez Family, The","Like Dottie herself, the film is all dressed up with nowhere to go.",786
"Perez Family, The","The conclusion rushes by without sufficient development: You feel like there's a scene or two missing. But the movie ends with such optimism and bittersweet nostalgia, it sends you out smiling.",786
"Perez Family, The","With non-Hispanic principal actors and Indian-born Mira Nair directing, this garish romance is a bit of an ethnic pot-pourri, but it's not quite as annoying as it sounds. Huston, in particular, gives it a touch of genuine class.",786
"Perez Family, The","Mira Nair's consistent exploration of the search for home is admirable, but her movie is burdened by an unconvincing ensemble that's unable to elevate the serio-comic exploration of Cuban immigrants into a poignant tale.",786
"Perez Family, The",Sensuous and lush with a hint of Allende's magical realism in the bleeding of a man's broken heart and a string of rose petals trailing a line along the belly of a new lover.,786
"Perez Family, The","Mira Nair's Mississippi Masala found humor in ethnic chaos, and the Indian-born director does so again.",786
"Perez Family, The","The movie sometimes bends the plausible to set up a laugh, and most of the time I didn't care, because I was enjoying the company of the characters.",786

Roommates,"The pieces were in place for a nice little story, but by trying to do too much with it, Roommates overshoots the runway.",787
Swimming with Sharks,"Shot in a cramped and stage-like style, and sounding like warmed- over Mamet, Swimming With Sharks tries to go for the big picture but comes up empty from the first frame to the last.",789
Swimming with Sharks,"'Swimming with Sharks', although it is peak 90s in terms of some scripted dialog on outdated movie references about Shelly Winters and has some super choppy editing, is a fantastic movie to watch.",789
Swimming with Sharks,"Unfortunately, Spacey's no-holds-barred portrait is about the only reason to take in Huang's low-budget, writing-directing debut. The story line proceeds predictably, though often unpersuasively.",789
Swimming with Sharks,"Despite some sharp dialogue, this is a nasty, derivative film, sort of a cross between Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs and Altman's The Player.",789
Swimming with Sharks,The picture's raison d'être has to be Spacey's 'loud and nasty' performance: he's the sort of actor who grabs you by the throat and beats you about the head without ever lifting his feet from the desk.,789
Swimming with Sharks,...Spacey delivers one of his most memorable performances...,789
Swimming with Sharks,"It's darkly hilarious, smoothly entertaining, and almost sinfully cruel. And the finalé packs a real stinger.",789
Swimming with Sharks,Dazzling and subversive satire on boss-employee relations.,789
Swimming with Sharks,One of the best film's of the 90's...Spacey and Whaley are staggeringly good!,789
Swimming with Sharks,"Mr. Spacey's Buddy is a caricature so dazzling that even Buddy might have to say something nice about it: cool, withering, studiously suave, and spurred by impulses that might seem peevish even in a 2-year-old child.",789
Tommy Boy,Peter Segal's dismal Tommy Boy is the latest addition to Hollywood's cult of moron.,790
Tommy Boy,"Farley and his sidekick David Spade hail from Saturday Night Live, but this lowbrow vehicle has none of the goofy charm that made Wayne's World a viable spinoff.",790
Tommy Boy,Farley has a great deal of energy and a cheerful screen presence. It's impossible not to like him at the same time that you can merely shake your head at this flick.,790
Tommy Boy,"Mostly this is one long, loud, stupid road picture.",790
Tommy Boy,"Dumber than Dumb and Dumber, Tommy Boy is a comedy that might be a hoot after several beers but is otherwise best avoided.",790
Tommy Boy,re-do it as a 10-15 minute motivational tape as a seminar for business and sales people,790
Tommy Boy,"Raunchy, funny, and not for younger kids.",790
Tommy Boy,"Farley and Spade have a definite chemistry, and they do their best to pick up the slack. [Blu-ray]",790
Tommy Boy,"Against the odds of a feeble script and uninspired direction the duo do, in fact, grow on you, and there are a smattering of silly laughs.",790
Tommy Boy,Inane and tasteless comedy of obesity and incompetence.,790

"Baby-Sitters Club, The","Though the script is predictable, it's not too clumsy.",791
"Baby-Sitters Club, The","Were there not 125 million of Ann M. Martin's Club books currently in print, this cinematically destitute movie might have gone directly to video.",791
"Baby-Sitters Club, The","The Baby-Sitters Club has a youthful buoyancy and whimsical rhythm that catches even the most jaundiced (i.e., 16-year-old) viewers up in its play of light and energy.",791
Bullets Over Broadway,"This, at best, is second-rate, unimportant Woody Allen. It tries much too hard and delivers only the obvious.",792
Bullets Over Broadway,One of Woody's best.,792
Bullets Over Broadway,"The joy of this bouncy, brainy Allen outing is how effortlessly he meshes his serious, clearly personal conundrums with the giddy formulas of backstage farce.",792

Bullets Over Broadway,A backstage comedy bolstered by healthy shots of prohibition gangster melodrama and romantic entanglements.,792
Bullets Over Broadway,Woody Allen at his finest. Wiest is sensational.,792
Crooklyn,"Unfathomable. Yet, as Crooklyn demonstrates, what may be out of reach for most is quite literally what Lee was born to do.",793
Crooklyn,An elegiac Bed-Stuy fairy tale.,793
Crooklyn,"Because Lee's previous films have been so fervently about something that they smothered much of the very humanity Crooklyn celebrates, the relaxed gait is strikingly apparent.",793
Crooklyn,"Apart from being the two female presences in the house, Carolyn sees singular fortitude and possibility in Troy. Their scenes together are the heart of the movie.",793
Crooklyn,Nuanced depiction of a black family in Brooklyn; language.,793
Crooklyn,In spite of the flaws of the Virginia interlude I really enjoyed this.,793
Crooklyn,"...a relaxed portrayal of African-American domesticity, anchored by strong performances.",793
Crooklyn,"Lee seems to confuse noise with drama: the bickering Carmichaels create quite a racket, but we're seldom moved by their plight. In his most desperate moment, Lee shoots a long sequence through a distorted lens.",793
Crooklyn,"Crooklyn, a gentle and touching tale of growing up in a melting-pot neighborhood of Brooklyn in the Partridge Family era, shows a different, more sentimental side of that cinematic firebrand, Spike Lee.",793
Crooklyn,"Lee is a great self-promoter. After all his press releases and all his interviews, we are given films that are sketchy, unfelt and distancing -- incidents in Lee's career, the only drama that really interests him.",793
It Could Happen to You,The idea of doing what’s right has rarely been delivered with as much twinkly hopefulness or underlying frankness.,794
It Could Happen to You,"But despite some uneven supporting character portrayals, It Could Happen to You delivers on pacing, laughs, and feel-good moments.",794
It Could Happen to You,"The whole film is charmingly, if not realistically, acted by Mr. Cage, who, in loving memory of Mr. Capra, succeeds in looking exactly like Mr. Stewart. Only the high, cracked voice is lacking.",794
It Could Happen to You,"For the dating crowd who embraced Sleepless in Seattle last year, this is their flick for this summer. Even if you don't have a date, you should let it happen to you.",794
It Could Happen to You,...generally comes off as an absolutely charming romantic comedy that benefits substantially from the unequivocal chemistry between its stars.,794
It Could Happen to You,Writer Jane Anderson is a gifted scenarist who seems constrained by a Hollywood formula which places the happy romantic ending on the horizon like a beacon to stare at for nearly two hours.,794
It Could Happen to You,"Bergman...really brings home the homage to Capra with the pic's warm, bordering-on-irresistible finale.",794
It Could Happen to You,Anderson's script manages to be both funny and touching without lapsing into undue sentiment.,794
It Could Happen to You,"Though set at present, this schmaltzy romantic comedy might as well have been set in the 1950s or even 1930s, because at heart it's a Capra comedy celebrating the decency of the ""little people.""",794
It Could Happen to You,"Perez has a field day as Muriel, injecting a welcome note of good old-fashioned greed into what is otherwise a relentlessly edifying story.",794
Richie Rich,The only good performance is that of Jonathan Hyde as the butler...,795
Richie Rich,"...fares terribly in its meandering, uneventful first half...",795

Richie Rich,Serviceable family entertainment.,795
Richie Rich,Decently crafted but oddly charmless.,795
Richie Rich,Unendurable.,795
Richie Rich,Plays on every kid's fantasy of being so wealthy that no one likes him.,795
Richie Rich,"It was fun for what it was...which is not very much, but hey...kids will get a kick out of it for all the fun gadgets.",795
Richie Rich,"Most of the time, Richie Rich is too busy oohing and ahhing over the junk that money can buy to relax and have a good time.",795
Richie Rich,"There's absolutely nothing here you haven't seen before, and while some kids might be mildly entertained, they would probably be even happier just staying home.",795
Speechless,"Speechless is an opportunity missed. When we think of the possibilities this situation provides, it is sad that the moviemakers took the low road.",796
Speechless,...a far-from-innovative yet certainly workable premise that's employed to mostly lifeless effect...,796
Speechless,This script needed to be completely overhauled before filming began.,796
Speechless,"Utterly devoid of subtlety and grace, Speechless is a desperate, thrown-together hodgepodge that tries to glide by on the supposedly surefire chemistry of the pairing of Davis and Keaton.",796
Speechless,"The rivalry never sparks, the pace flags and it seems pointless to enter donkeys in a race designed for thoroughbreds.",796
Speechless,"Never achieves the madcap hilarity of the '40s romantic comedies it seeks to emulate, and some of the dramatic moments feel a bit forced.",796
Speechless,"Mugging to an unfunny script, Keaton and Davis are no Tracy and Hepburn, and the funereal pace doesn't help.",796
Speechless,Toothless as political satire and bland as romantic comedy.,796
Speechless,"This is intelligent romantic comedy of the kind we get all too seldom these days, and the plot is something Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn would have loved in their prime.",796
Speechless,It comes down to the charms of Keaton and Davis in the end. You like these characters and root for them to score.,796
Timecop,"Directed by Peter Hyams without an ounce of suspense, too much testosterone, and little or no reason, Timecop takes the fun out of what has to be one of the most enduring human fantasies to go back and make things right.",797
Timecop,What we need here is a good deal more humor and less self-important plot twisting.,797
Timecop,"It's not a great filmic exploration of time travel or science-fiction themes, but it's still a decent amount of fun.",797
Timecop,This super-silly effort strays quite near the watchable thanks to it's looney-tunes time-travel angle.,797
Timecop,"A passable, sub-Terminator, time-travel adventure.",797
Timecop,Van Damme is compelling only when he takes his clothes off.,797
Timecop,This brainless romp [is] a real blast.,797
Timecop,"For the most part, Hyams' lackluster direction and the repetitive quality of the action sequences squander an intriguing premise and impressive production design, leaving few moments that elicit the sort of 'Wow!' response such fare needs in order to pros",797
Timecop,"More fun than expected sci-fi, cop flick starring Jean-Claude for kicks.",797
Timecop,"As time-travel pictures go, this Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle is a passable but disappointing excursion into well-traveled terrain.",797
Bad Company,"As the film begins to lose much of its momentum and forcefulness, it's nevertheless tough to rob Hopkins of an incredible screen presence.",798
Bad Company,Nuclear-bomb-in-NYC plot leaves sour aftertaste.,798
Bad Company,"Director Joel Schumacher does a fair job of managing the chaos, but after a while you get tired of being dragged from setup to setup.",798
Bad Company,Two hours of my life I will never be able to get back...,798
Bad Company,"Everything about has been done and seen before--even right down to the title, which the very same studio used as the moniker for a Laurence Fishburne/Ellen Barkin thriller.",798
Bad Company,"The action fails to cause any excitement, and most of the characters are paper-thin.",798
Bad Company,"O roteiro absurdo, a direo de Schumacher fraca e o filme, em si, simplesmente ridculo.",798
Bad Company,"Rock is trying too hard, and Hopkins isn't trying at all.",798
Bad Company,The funniest thing about Bad Company is that Hopkins actually agreed to star in it.,798
Bad Company,"An easy watch, except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character.",798
Boys Life,"The beauty of This Boy's Life is in the details: this meticulously observed story gets the look of the late '50s down pat and, more important, captures the dissonance between the era's ideals of nuclear-family life and painfully deracinated reality.",799
Boys Life,"The film demands ominous electricity between Dwight and Toby, the latter of whom endures various and sundry humiliation and harm at the former's hands. And there are times when DiCaprio doesn't just go toe-to-toe with De Niro but feels just as tall.",799
Boys Life,This is powerful and moving stuff.,799
Boys Life,"Something more subtle is going on in Wolff's book, a confrontation with a richer, quirkier past and his emerging self that the movie too often brushes aside.",799
Boys Life,"The leads work overtime to make their characters and their relationships pungent, believable, and moving.",799
Boys Life,"De Niro and Birkin are reliable in this atmospheric drama, but it's DiCaprio who really shines.",799
Boys Life,"A young DiCaprio steals the show in this tale of learning how to be a man, with a sly De Niro also giving a good performance, but with a plot that drags on too long.",799
Boys Life,Nicely acted but excessively bland.,799
Boys Life,"A powerful if familiar family melodrama with a bravura performance from newcomer Leonardo DiCaprio, who's bound to become a major actor in the future.",799
Boys Life,It's a rites-of-passage drama with the kind of period small-town setting that the director is making his own.,799
In the Mouth of Madness,"John Carpenter's treatise on the psychological power of horror begins well, only to descend rapidly into special-effects genre cliché.",800
In the Mouth of Madness,"The film articulates that moral standards are representative of a dominant system of beliefs rather than an ingrained sense of righteousness, and that the fabric of our experience with the natural world itself can be altered through an infectious idea.",800
In the Mouth of Madness,Carpenter's work with music and sound design has never been so radical and the film's set pieces are breathtakingly executed.,800
In the Mouth of Madness,John Carpenter's 1994 finale to his Apocalypse Trilogy is a no-holds-barred blitzkrieg of horror that will have you watching the movie a second time just to confirm that you did indeed see what you think you saw.,800
In the Mouth of Madness,"In the Mouth of Madness is a film that defies expectations and promises to be an unsettling journey. Imaginative and distinct, it’s a treat for all horror fans to embrace with plenty of tricks along the way.",800
In the Mouth of Madness,"In the Mouth of Madness isn't John Carpenter's best horror movie to date, but it may well be his scariest.",800
In the Mouth of Madness,"While it's more ambitious than most Carpenter works from this period, it's not any more satisfying.",800
In the Mouth of Madness,This is one of those self- referential horror movies that gets buried alive in an avalanche of clever special effects and an incredible imploding plot.,800
In the Mouth of Madness,This is one of the best Lovecraft adaptations committed to film and it's not even based on any of his works!,800
In the Mouth of Madness,"The most simplified stories are often the best ones...it's not just an entertaining Twilight Zone-esque film, you can really tell that Carpenter and De Luca were trying to create something different.",800

"Air Up There, The",It's pure formula from start to finish.,801
"Air Up There, The","Working a bit too hard to send the crowd into a frenzy, the action in this basketball-oriented yarn isn't exactly fantastic, but it is mildly entertaining.",801
"Air Up There, The","Give or take the odd spot of predictable arrogance, however, it's a good-humoured, good-hearted film.",801
"Air Up There, The",Wonderful sports comedy full of inspiring moments and exciting basketball action.,801
"Air Up There, The","Children may find this funny, but the film isn't geared to very young audiences. It includes much more violence and profanity than its PG rating indicates.",801
"Air Up There, The",Not nearly as bad as you think.,801
"Air Up There, The",Entirely predictable basketball comedy. Bacon gives better than the flick really deserves.,801
"Air Up There, The","Offensive, shop-worn comedy.",801
Hard Target,...the movie improves considerably once it progresses into an increasingly enthralling second half...,802
Hard Target,"Don't expect too much from Hard Target, and you won't be disappointed. Shoot-em-up action films have a limited range, but John Woo and company take this one to the limit.",802
Hard Target,"the second half plays like an all-out action extravaganza, a symphony of bullet-strewn slow motion and hyper-real physicality",802
Hard Target,"Wilford Brimley pops up as Uncle Douvee; he's supposed to be Cajun, but he sounds more like Maurice Chevalier shot full of Novocain.",802
Hard Target,A watershed moment for action cinema.,802
Hard Target,Van Damme's Martial Arts stunts are second to none and back in the early 1990's he was in tip top shape.,802
Hard Target,"The most satisfying entry in Van Damme's rise to glory during the early 1990s, smartly using the star's limited vocabulary and limitless flexibility to create one of the finest B-movies of the decade.",802
Hard Target,The combo is an incendiary mix: Woo unleashes all barrels in vintage Hong Kong action style while Van Damme delivers not only his martial-arts prowess but some well-developed acting skills as well.,802
Hard Target,"With its expert use of dissolves and pans, Hard Target is an arty shot of adrenaline to this overworked genre.",802
Hard Target,"This is Woo's American debut and it's not as individualistic as his Hong Kong gangster films, but there's also less of his sentimentality and corny humour. The performances are more consistent too.",802
Heaven & Earth,"While the third film in Oliver Stone’s Vietnam War trilogy is easily the weakest, it nevertheless deserved a better fate than it received.",803
Heaven & Earth,Stone rams the heroine’s agony down your throat instead of letting you feel it for yourself.,803
Heaven & Earth,"From the moment the war intrudes on the landscape with the coming of the French troops in the 1950s, the mood is somber and almost ceremonial and perhaps for that reason the many emotional scenes fail to move us.",803
Heaven & Earth,...despite every intention the movie can't quite shake its American male point of view.,803
Heaven & Earth,Some of the parts are undeniably gripping; what gets lost are the characters themselves.,803
Heaven & Earth,What Oliver Stone has created is his Mrs. Miniver for the Vietnam era.,803
Heaven & Earth,"Overblown, forgettable Oliver Stone epic.",803
Heaven & Earth,"Mr. Stone tells this tale vigorously, but he has the wrong cinematic vocabulary for his heroine's essentially passive experience.",803
Heaven & Earth,Touches the heart not only as a cross-cultural treasure but as Oliver Stone's most soulful movie.,803
Heaven & Earth,"Heaven has so many themes, ranging from Buddhist spirituality to feminism, it ends up with none.",803
Jimmy Hollywood,"It's an entertaining movie but Joe Pesci, as Jimmy, may be the worst bit of casting that master caster Levinson has ever done.",804
Jimmy Hollywood,"The movie goes on too long, and the ending is milked too heavily for irony, but it makes you sit up and watch—it’s serious fun.",804

Manhattan Murder Mystery,"The philosophy-free plot, as lightweight as a lemon meringue pie, recalls (to paraphrase Stardust Memories) Allen's early, funny pictures.",805
Manhattan Murder Mystery,'Manhattan Murder Mystery' is the film made by the filmmaker who hits the excellence with various casting choices. [Full Review in Spanish],805

Manhattan Murder Mystery,Witty Woody Allen film about marriage and maybe murder.,805

Manhattan Murder Mystery,"A movie inspired by movie escapism. Minor, but surprisingly, almost defiantly upbeat.",805
Manhattan Murder Mystery,...Woody Allen at his best.,805
Menace II Society,"With a tragic hero at its heart, the Hughes brothers’ debut drama painted nuanced portraits of characters rarely fleshed out in other films.",806
Menace II Society,"A lot like Boyz N Da Hood released two years earlier, it is a bleak picture and captures lightning in a bottle in which the city was still fuming from the Rodney King riots.",806
Menace II Society,"Now that it is a Criterion release with a stunning 4K restoration, [Menace II Society] remains an important chapter in understanding why the streets are more than what is stereotypically portrayed in the media.",806
Menace II Society,Remains a powerful indictment of a country which was failing young black men in in the 1990s.,806
Menace II Society,"From its shocking opening sequence to its fatalistic finale, Menace II Society is a raw and (mostly) realistic drama.",806
Menace II Society,"There's no denying the visceral power of the Hughes Brothers' vision, but - with the exception of Pinkett - it's hard to have sympathy for any of the characters.",806
Menace II Society,"Rather than being a positive step toward a solution, this one-sided, inflammatory film and its after-effects on impressionable youth may be yet another menace for American society to suffer.",806
Menace II Society,The Hughes brothers are torn between the hopelessness of what they depict and a kind of haloed view of a better life.,806
Menace II Society,"It's a movie that takes you where you might not want to go, and makes you care about hell in a very small place.",806
Menace II Society,"A film like Menace II Society isn't simply a bit of crime-thriller entertainment from the hoods of South Central Los Angeles, it's a true learning experience.",806
Poetic Justice,"Outside of a certain demographic, it's just not going to hit the same way.",807
Poetic Justice,"It was fine, I loved Janet Jackson, but for me watching it now, my brain is blank. it wasn't terrible, wasn't good, it was just there. Respect to a Black romantic drama revered in the community, but I'd rather watch Love & Basketball...",807
Poetic Justice,"In short, the movie's pretty much of a mess, as it struggles with big themes but hasn't figured out what to do with them.",807
Poetic Justice,"Its ambitious aims are commendable in themselves, but regrettable since they overinflate what might have been a simpler and better film.",807
Poetic Justice,"If what you really want to see is a simple love story, this is the picture for you. Simple it is, as in simple-minded.",807
Poetic Justice,"After a deceptively funny and offbeat beginning, the movie keeps restarting; each new start shows some promise, and Singleton's talent never really deserts him-but the parts don't come together to create a unified story.",807
Poetic Justice,"""Poetic Justice"" is a disappointment.",807
Poetic Justice,"After making a big splash with his first film, Boyz N the Hood, John Singleton lost his way somewhat with this twee, right-on drama.",807
Poetic Justice,Some good performances are balanced out by the film's contrivances and gratuitously foul-mouthed characters.,807
Poetic Justice,"""Poetic Justice"" is thoroughly watchable. The director's script has bite, he is fluid with his camerawork and his eye and ear for details, particularly the details of female life, are superb.",807
Rising Sun,"It is a testament to a way of life that is now largely gone and a way of honouring and remembering the daily lives of rural communities. As such, the film gives importance to the everyday moments of ordinary, mundane life.",809
Rising Sun,"A slow steeping in the rhythms and rituals of a community in the rural Ireland of the 1980s, what Collins’ adaptation of John McGahern‘s final novel lacks in incident it more than makes up for in rich character and a gruff, earthy compassion.",809
Rising Sun,"This is a slow piece of great warmth and sympathy that invites viewers to find the beauty in birdsong, long grass and works left half-finished.",809
Rising Sun,"Having already made a celebrated documentary on John McGahern, Pat Collins was always going to be the right director to make this film but his own distinctive style makes him an ideal choice as well.",809
Rising Sun,"This sometimes feels a bit overwritten, but the film is packed with lovely insight.",809
Rising Sun,"There’s not much more to the film than that: the passing of the seasons, a death, a marriage, all sewn together with excerpts of Joe’s writing... But the film casts a drowsy spell, like a summer meadow you cannot quite bring yourself to leave.",809
Rising Sun,"Pat Collins has made many fine films down the years, and surpasses himself with this elegiac adaptation of John McGahern’s final novel.",809
Rising Sun,"Subtle, sensitive, and dynamically understated throughout, Barry Ward is the fulcrum of this quietly magnificent film experience.",809
Rising Sun,This glorious adaptation of the late John McGahern's final novel is the big-screen equivalent of the grand stretch and should be regarded with the same sense of wonder.,809
Rising Sun,"The provincial life, told in delicate movements in a script by Collins and Eamon Little, asks big questions about the nature of happiness. A half-finished garden structure is emblematic of a larger temporal standstill.",809
Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould,"Instead of a laborious bio-pic, we get a sly, quick-witted meditation on a character always likely to elude our grasp.",811
Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould,"If only more filmmakers would take the fragmented, kaleidoscopic approach of Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould, which captures the essence of the famed pianist (and radio broadcaster) by honoring his unruliness.",811
Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould,"One of the great documentaries, or if you will semi-documentaries.",811
Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould,"An assured melange of dramatic re-creation, archival material and interviews, it is a uniquely entertaining venture",811
Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould,"The film's strategy is to present many diverse fragments about Gould, each capturing an aspect of his artistry and/or personality, so that the cumulative effect would give the viewer a glimpse of the man and his times.",811
Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould,...but not one long one.,811
Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould,An engaging and rather appropriate perspective on the gifted and eccentric musician.,811
Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould,A brilliant and transfixing cinematic portrait by Francois Girard.,811
Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould,"These episodic adventures are a joy to watch and although not all of them are as memorable as each other, each has an entertaining quality that means the film as a whole will stick with you for a long time.",811
Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould,Imaginative and engaging work of art which pioneers a new form of screen biography.,811
"Celluloid Closet, The",An excellent documentary.,813

"Celluloid Closet, The",Lively and absorbing.,813
"Celluloid Closet, The","This intelligent, fascinating film - based on the book by Vito Russo - is well worth a watch and is stuffed full of clips and contributions from stars, directors, screenwriters and academics.",813
"Celluloid Closet, The","""The Celluloid Closet"" goes all the way back to the birth of cinema, to an experimental Thomas Edison short of two men dancing, to trace the odd, funny, sad and disgraceful history of homosexual iconography on film.",813
"Celluloid Closet, The",A fascinating account of how Hollywood has dealt with homosexuals and homosexuality through its history.,813
"Celluloid Closet, The","Opening the door of the celluloid closet reveals a shifting kaleidoscope that underlines just how influential, for good or bad, the movies can be.",813
"Celluloid Closet, The",How ironic that a movie about the dangers of the closet would so confine one's freedom of interpretation.,813
"Celluloid Closet, The","An immensely entertaining, galloping reflection on screen perceptions of lesbians and gay men, from the humorous to the heinous to the heartening.",813
"Celluloid Closet, The","A witty, touching study of Hollywood's (mostly on screen) treatment of homosexuality.",813
"Great Day in Harlem, A",The film is alive and keeps moving briskly.,814
"Great Day in Harlem, A","If you wanted to introduce someone to what jazz is all about, this would be an ideal place to start.",814
"Great Day in Harlem, A","Even casual fans should appreciate the film's genuine admiration for these great artists, whose lives were interwoven with their creativity and who changed the face of 20th-century music.",814
"Great Day in Harlem, A","For non-buffs, pic fails the acid test of exciting interest where there was little or none before; it could easily have covered the same ground in half its length.",814
"Great Day in Harlem, A","A fascinating examination of the artistry, camaraderie and idiosyncrasies among a generation enigmatic jazz giants.",814
"Great Day in Harlem, A","A wonderful, warm little movie.",814

"Great Day in Harlem, A",Monumental.,814
"Great Day in Harlem, A","Anyone with the misconception that the spirit of a particular music is not a direct reflection of the souls of the musicians who created it must see A Great Day in Harlem, Jean Bach's small and very moving documentary about the jazz life.",814
"Great Day in Harlem, A","Combining home movies, interviews from the time, contemporary reminiscences from locals and those who took part, and fascinating performance footage, this is a joyful celebration of an extraordinary event and of jazz music in general.",814
One Fine Day,"One Fine Day is not only the epitome of such, it strangely harkens back more to the films of the romantic films of the 1930s than it does to the romances of the late 1980s.",815
One Fine Day,"With oodles of charm, it turns its ""meet hate"" into a ""meet cute"" with two appealing stars.",815
One Fine Day,An affable romcom...,815
One Fine Day,"The formula remains evergreen -- two attractive leads are thrown together by quirk; develop antipathies, even loathing; then, ultimately decide they have overreacted and are hopelessly in love.",815
One Fine Day,"If you're a big Pfeiffer fan, you'll be horribly disappointed.",815
One Fine Day,Co-writers Ellen Simon and Terrel Seltzer bring sophisticated sensibilities to the film that add up to a '90s approximation of a screwball comedy.,815
One Fine Day,"Privilege and coincidence have always been central to screwball comedy, but the speed of crosstown travel here rivals Die Hard 3 for plausibility.",815
One Fine Day,Remarkable chemistry between the impossibly glamorous pair of Pfeiffer and Clooney.,815
One Fine Day,Excellent romantic comedy. Exciting story of adults trying to succeed in careers with the drawbacks of children.,815
One Fine Day,"One Fine Day is not only the epitome of such, it strangely harkens back more to the films of the romantic films of the 1930s than it does to the romances of the late 1980s.",815
Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh,"They still want a Dracula type seducer and for audiences to lust after the protagonist, but the filmmakers refuse to put in the work to depict a paternal supernatural bond. Incest is not sexy.",816
Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh,I wouldn't recommend watching this sequel. It is not worthy of following the original.,816
Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh,This wasn't enjoyable and made Candyman more absurd than terrifying...,816
Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh,"As it is, it is likely to be ignored as the silly tripe it is.",816
Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh,"It's a work of horror filled with serious issues about confronting America's racist past, but it's made with cheap jump-scares and afflicted by a bad case of sequelitis.",816
Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh,A pretty lazy and slapdash sequel that takes the path of very least resistance: re-running everything from the original with a slightly different color of paint.,816
Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh,"It doesn't live up to the first one... but if you're going to watch one of the sequels, this one would be it.",816
Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh,No more bland white ladies at the front and center of black stories.,816
Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh,"More of a remake than a continuation, it provides moderate amusement, but ultimately only for audiences itching for continued massacres from the vengeful, cursed specter.",816
Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh,Eschews the spooky scares of Candyman for pure gruesome schlock as Condon tragically waters down the original's supernatural strength.,816
Frisk,"Aiming to explore the extremities of racial and sexual fetishism in the gay world, Frisk exhibits a huge gap between its provocative intent and weak execution level.",817
Frisk,Self-loathing has never looked so amateurish...,817
Girl 6,"Not one of Lee’s best, but better than most critics claimed. Worth seeing just to catch Spike as George Jefferson.",818
Girl 6,"Just when you thought that director Spike Lee was beginning to be predictable with his movie subject matter, he reshuffles the deck and pulls a wild card from his sleeve.",818
Girl 6,"Though featuring classic Lee-missteps-a bloated third act, heavy moralizing around Black women's sexualities-the real lynchpin in Girl 6 is Randle.",818
Girl 6,About as fulfilling as phone-sex.,818
Girl 6,"While it's often quite funny, Spike Lee's newest is really a surprisingly vivid dramatic study of an aspiring actress in moonlighting hell.",818
Girl 6,"[Randle] holds the film together as best she can with her luminous presence and dignity, but can't supply the lacking subtext, past history and motivation.",818
Girl 6,"Lee is back to his independent roots, doesn't have an axe to grind and just enjoys playing with the camera and letting the actors, especially Randle, do the right thing.",818
Girl 6,"Slight and superficial, Spike Lee's look at the phone-sex industry through the life of one femme is completely from the outside.",818
Girl 6,"There's something refreshing about the film's reckless proximity to anarchy, the stylishly imaginative cinematography and lusciously exorbitant Prince soundtrack, even if it does ring hollow when Lee tries to get serious on us.",818
Girl 6,"Girl 6, the story of a girl and her stint in the phone sex biz, is a sloppy and problematic film, no diggity.",818
Space Jam,"Space Jam: A New Legacy may go a little overboard with its cross branding, but it is certainly not the worst thing ever.",820
Space Jam,"A lifeless script, amateurish acting and an over dependence on filling the background with familiar extras add up to a losing effort.",820
Space Jam,"I laughed, & some of the gags in here were just a joyous ride!",820
Space Jam,"Children are easy to please with the broad slapstick and general loudness of A New Legacy, but for their adult accompaniments, the second take on a sentimental movie is a chore, especially without Bill Murray.",820
Space Jam,"Space Jam: A New Legacy brings a film meant to be enjoyed by everyone whether you are 12-years-old, a millennial inundated in pop culture, or from an older generation who grew up on WB IPs.",820
Space Jam,Space Jam: A New Legacy is nothing but a giant infomercial for its legendary studio.,820
Space Jam,It’s not so much a movie as it is one massive marketing exercise with WB using it to highlight their many IPs and James using it to boost his brand.,820
Space Jam,"Director Malcolm D. Lee made the hilarious Girls Trip, but this film feels too workshopped and audience-tested to match that same organic sense of humour.",820
Space Jam,"You Do You is the meaningful thematic depth of the studio's literally on-brand reboot, and that will be fine for the family audience drawn to this mostly fun, often frantic romp.",820
Space Jam,"Space Jam was about self-belief, whereas this seems to be about corporate synergy.",820
Mrs. Winterbourne,Shirley MacLaine gives a classic performance as the matriarch of the Winterbourne family.,821
Mrs. Winterbourne,"Stealing every scene he gets is the laughable Miguel Sandoval as Paco, the family chauffeur, and the only one who will stand up to the formidable Grace Winterbourne.",821
Mrs. Winterbourne,...watchable and unexpectedly engaging...,821
Mrs. Winterbourne,The result is indigestible.,821
Mrs. Winterbourne,"For a Cinderella story, it's sorely without magic.",821
Mrs. Winterbourne,"The brazen sentimentality at work here -- while effective in the context of what some might call ""a chick flick""-- doesn't give the material much weight.",821
Mrs. Winterbourne,"A clunky, forced romantic comedy of mistaken identity that might as well have been called While You Were Dead.",821
Mrs. Winterbourne,Lake is a rather chilly and distinctly unpersuasive presence.,821
Mrs. Winterbourne,"You'll be saying 'No, Ricki!' instead of 'Go Ricki!'",821
Mrs. Winterbourne,"Cute and relatively inoffensive. At times, even funny.",821
Faces,Has no redeeming value as entertainment or any educational value.,822
Faces,"Many of the segments have lost their ability to shock, or can easily be recognized as fake by today's more media-savvy audience. Interesting as a curious bit of film history, but nothing more.",822
Faces,"Without the carrot of controversy to draw in viewers, Faces of Death would have only the stick of unconvincing faux-documentary footage.",822
Faces,Sleazy little relic of a movie. Rather fine DVD release that demystifies the whole thing.,822
Faces,"As a curiosity piece, Faces of Death is well worth a look, especially if you've not seen it in a very long time. As for its place in horror cinema history, well, that remains to be seen.",822
Faces,"Crude, tasteless exploitation footage. Filmed carnage. Be ashamed to watch this garbage.",822
Faces,An inexcusable violation of human codes of decency.,822
Faces,Consistently awful,822
Mulholland Falls,Tamahori struggles to find a character balance that brings out the intended feeling of partnership and personal sacrifice.,823
Mulholland Falls,"It may betray its genre intentions, but it's nevertheless well-acted and routinely entertaining.",823
Mulholland Falls,"The cast is really good, the story is interesting but it was kind of a let down at the end.",823
Mulholland Falls,An imperfect but still entertaining neo-noir mystery.,823
Mulholland Falls,...a watchable endeavor that's nevertheless a marked disappointment...,823
Mulholland Falls,How could it miss? Let me count the ways.,823
Mulholland Falls,An uneven mystery-thriller that suffers from a plot that wanders in too many directions and an overabundance of underdeveloped characters.,823
Mulholland Falls,A great cast helps this wandering modern noir a whole heck of a lot.,823
Mulholland Falls,"After watching Lee Tamahori's failed, cameo-studded attempt at neo-noir, one can only wonder how it attracted such an interesting array of talent.",823
Mulholland Falls,"It didn't make any sense, but it was great!",823
"Great White Hype, The",Not the worst but very far from being a serviceable film. I doubt there was really a script for this based on the ramblings of the actors in every scene.,824
"Great White Hype, The",This was one of the worst sports movies I have seen. This was so joyless I almost wish I had just read the Wikipedia page instead of spending 90 minutes watching this...,824
"Great White Hype, The","A knock out, no question.",824
"Great White Hype, The","There is some fly dialogue, but it's not a knockout.",824
"Great White Hype, The","The joke is often funny and the actors all look like they're having fun, but it's still a one-joke movie that falls short of its potential",824
"Great White Hype, The",A knockout comedy...Peter Berg is a trip!,824
"Great White Hype, The","Breezy, biting fun.",824
"Great White Hype, The","It starts out well, as a wicked satire on professional boxing, and then loses its energy, tires of juggling its characters and ends so abruptly at 91 minutes that it feels like the last reel is missing.",824
"Great White Hype, The",Not the worst but very far from being a serviceable film. I doubt there was really a script for this based on the ramblings of the actors in every scene.,824

"Arrival, The","E.T. would find it false propaganda, but for fans of the genre, it's standard sci-fi with all the needed ingredients.",825
"Arrival, The","The film starts to fall apart at the introduction of the aliens themselves, which suffer from dated special effects and an immediate aura of disbelief.",825
"Arrival, The","The CGI alien special effects are only so-so, but the film is rich in ideas, well-executed and is pleasingly entertaining even if silly.",825
"Arrival, The",Less an alien invasion movie than a conspiracy film (it just hapens to turn out that the conspirators are aliens).,825
"Arrival, The","What it lacks in sophistication (everything), it partly makes up for in sheer gall.",825
"Arrival, The",You know a movie's in trouble when it's called The Arrival and nothing arrives -- the film's aliens are already here.,825
"Arrival, The",The aliens-among-us plot gets a very entertaining and inventive update.,825
"Arrival, The","A good premise, hampered by a weak ending.",825
"Arrival, The",...it ultimately seems apparent that the movie would've been well-served had it topped out at 90 minutes (ie it's too long and feels it).,825
"Arrival, The","It's a strong, lean piece of writing that moves quickly. Nothing is wasted, and nothing happens the way you'd expect.",825

Alaska,"With so many characters and plotlines, it seems that TV king Kelley mistook this big-screen assignment for another network pilot.",828
Alaska,"...completely inoffensive -- if you don't mind old ladies and little children saying shockingly rude things. But it's no Slap Shot, if that's what you wanted to know.",828
Alaska,O roteiro cria uma srie de subtramas que jamais se tornam relevantes e - o que pior - mergulham no mais puro clich.,828
Alaska,"No matter how stale the storyline, these actors breathe fresh emotion into it.",828
Alaska,"While sports may well be the toy department of life, hanging out there is often what creates and sustains community.",828
Alaska,"The only thing that saves it from being total trash is the skill of the lead actors, who make the best out of nothing.",828
Alaska,"Director Jay Roach meanders through rambling, heart-tugging, try-too-hard material that holds few surprises.",828
Fled,"My fondest memory involving Fled isn’t on the screen; instead, it was the moment on Siskel & Ebert when Roger stated, “I guess it sort of holds your attention while it’s happening. I mean, something is moving on the screen, so you look to see what it is.”",829
Fled,"Even when violence and tragic incidents do occur, they're not exactly of the gut-wrenching kind.",829
Fled,Filmmaker Kevin Hooks does a superb job of immediately drawing the viewer into the briskly-paced proceedings...,829
Fled,Aren't you getting tired of battles over computer disks?,829
Fled,"The makers of this sluggish, by-the-numbers action pic couldn't even be bothered to exploit the obvious angles.",829
Fled,"Scripter Preston A. Whitmore II and helmer Kevin Hooks are obviously well-versed in film lore, for they have concocted a hodgepodge that recycles elements from several white-black team movies.",829
Fled,"Lots of physical energy, but little else.",829
Fled,One more stepping stone in the rise of Salma Hayek!,829
Fled,"Most of non-action scenes are dead serious, and in those moments Fled becomes unbearably cliched and tedious.",829
Fled,A generic buddy-buddy actioner that's not as slick as it thinks it is...pointless and forgettable,829
Escape from L.A.,"Not as iconic as Escape from New York, but still has some fun moments hidden behind pretty awful 90s-era visual effects.",831
Escape from L.A.,"This time around, Russell seems uncomfortable in the part–a cartoon of a cartoon–but the production design by Blade Runner’s Lawrence G. Paull is so attractive and inventive that this is probably Carpenter’s most visually impressive feature.",831
Escape from L.A.,"If viewers focus on what Carpenter is trying to say, as opposed to the half-hearted method in which he tries to say it, Escape from L.A. becomes a guilty pleasure and thought-provoking look at Carpenter’s worldview.",831
Escape from L.A.,"At least audiences never had to sit through any more urban-centered follow-ups, be it Escape from Miami, Escape from Chicago, or even Escape from Woonsocket, Rhode Island.",831
Escape from L.A.,"If you have never seen this sequel, I suggest you dont compare it to Escape from New York, because they are as different as the two movies could be.",831
Escape from L.A.,"If you feel similarly and have been jonesing for a chance to revisit Carpenters L.A., I only recommend that you wait until Paramount fixes the audio. Only then would this be a solid recommendation.",831
Escape from L.A.,A slam-bang sequel with a brazenly nihilistic sense of humor.,831
Escape from L.A.,"...its CGI is frankly cartoonish, while the composites that make up that surfboard ride down Wilshire Boulevard are...unconvincing...",831
Escape from L.A.,"Some of the numerous, offbeat personas bring welcome diversity, while others only help to make things more uncomfortably bizarre.",831
Escape from L.A.,A slightly underwhelming sequel to the great Escape from New York. But not without its cheesy only-in-the-1990s charm.,831
Bogus,"It uses the Terminator franchise as a great jumping point for the shenanigans that create the momentum of the film, but it also tackles popular culture depictions of heaven and hell in counterintuitive ways that are not always played for laughs.",832
Bogus,"With its greater resources, the film enjoys more sets, more props, and more computer animation - none of which increases the quality or the entertainment value.",832
Bogus,Having an actual bad guy changes the dynamic to something less fun and more serious... but the inclusion of Death as a wild card provides a new too-serious foil for Bill and Ted to happily torment.,832
Bogus,"An extraordinary grab bag of conceits and jokes, unified only in that Winters and Reeves treat everything with the same effortless merriment and slacker philosophy.",832
Bogus,"Wacky and weird and nonsensical, it's hardly satire but the sheer invention of their ludicrous journey will have most dudes rolling on the floor.",832
Bogus,"[UPDATED 2024 4K + BLU-RAY REVIEW] William Sadler steals the film -- nay, the entire series -- with his hilarious turn as The Grim Reaper ... but aside from a few chuckles, the remainder is overstuffed and overindulgent.",832
Bogus,"Once Bill and Ted get out of hell, though, their film loses it -- in more ways than one.",832
Bogus,"It is Sadler, as Death, who makes this film the partial pleasure it is.",832
Bogus,"Sorry, dudes: This is a totally bogus sequel.",832
Bogus,Reeves and Winter are clearly having a wonderful time. The enthusiasm is contagious.,832
Bulletproof,...a forgettable actioner that consistently wastes the talents of its two stars.,833
Bulletproof,"The criminal activity onscreen in Bulletproof is penny ante compared with the felonious slaughter of story, character and logic exacted by the pic's filmmakers.",833
Bulletproof,"Bring back Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy, please!",833
Bulletproof,An entertaining little ditty that I enjoyed watching.,833
Bulletproof,A throwback to when Adam Sandler was funny.,833
Bulletproof,A tiresome Sandler-Wayans buddy-buddy crime actioner that needs its staid material to be desperately riddled with bullets.,833
Bulletproof,"It's not a great movie, but it is an adequate late summer diversion.",833
Bulletproof,"Fairly weak ""buddy"" pic with both actors playing below par.",833
Bulletproof,Midnight Run did it best; 48 hours runs a fair second. Bulletproof finishes way back in the pack.,833
Bulletproof,Double the unexcitement!,833
Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,"While not the worst of the series, it's unsurprising that the installment that followed three years later brought back Curtis to take a much stronger stab at getting the series back on track.",834
Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,Here’s an installment in the Halloween franchise with two vastly different versions—and they’re both bad.,834
Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,The commendable atmosphere is tainted by a ridiculous story and incoherent editing. This sequel is notorious for it's production issues and multiple cuts. It's unfortunate that neither officially-released cut is a good version of this movie.,834
Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,"Curse is definitely the most controversial with its cultish plotline. Sometime chaos creates beauty, and I find a lot in 6. An unapologetic Myers, an energetic performance by Paul Rudd, and painted on atmosphere by the gallons.",834
Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,"Just too strange, too outlandish, and too convoluted to be frightening, serving as a constant reminder of just how far away we are from the world created by John Carpenter.",834
Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,This franchise-derailing entry commits the cardinal sin of demystifying Michael Myers with a howlingly silly origin story.,834
Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,"Instead of sending up the current glut of serial-killer movies, the filmmakers trot out the old slasher tactics.",834
Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,"Every convention of the old slasher film is here, including some incredibly stupid motivation, hastily sketched characters and incomprehensible plot twists.",834
Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,I'd say everybody associated with this film-from unrelenting series producer Moustapha Akkad on down-could do with a good checkup.,834
Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,"A film bereft or surprises, or even suspense, and seems to get off on creating vicious murders to compensate for lack of genuine terror.",834
"Gay Divorcee, The","Also standard for their pictures, Astaire finds time to sing and dance alone, for his own amusement, as he ponders how to win over the girl.",835
"Gay Divorcee, The","Though it's longer than it should be, it seems shorter than it actually is, thanks to Fred Astaire.",835
"Gay Divorcee, The","Fred Astaire's first starring film, worth seeing for the Cole Porter tunes and the superb dancing and clowning of the star, himself.",835
"Gay Divorcee, The",Astaire and Rogers are so elegantly in sync that the ill-fitting conventions simply melt away,835
"Gay Divorcee, The","The Gay Divorcee offers a terrific mix of wit, humor, and, of course, song-and-dance.",835
"Gay Divorcee, The","The second, charming teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, probably his best dancing partner",835
"Gay Divorcee, The",Aimed at cheering up a Depression audience--which it does do with animated song and dance numbers.,835
"Gay Divorcee, The","As far as musical comedies go, this one wasn't musical enough.",835
"Gay Divorcee, The",Just fast forward to the dance numbers and you'll be in heaven.,835
"Gay Divorcee, The","Not the best Fred and Ginger film, but not far from it. The 17 minute ""Continental"" is a stunner.",835
Ninotchka,"This is without doubt one of the funniest, most original screen comedies ever made, and from the greatest year in Hollywood's history.",836
Ninotchka,The picture itself might have been a very amusing satire at the expense of the Russians if it had been made with any thing lighter than a loaded baseball bat.,836
Ninotchka,Ninotchka continues to enchant viewers all over the world and it hasn’t lost any of its charm in the past 82 years.,836
Ninotchka,"Has there ever been a more charming, sexy, infectious laugh put to film than the one Greta Garbo delivers in Ninotchka?",836
Ninotchka,"The finale is a welcome surprise (of sorts), returning to the dependable romance of lighthearted fantasy that had disappeared with the austerity and poverty of Russia.",836
Ninotchka,"Following the fashion of so many of Hollywood's more serious actresses who are turning to lighter roles, Greta Garbo, in her newest picture, brings a smile to her face and a rare buoyancy to her step.",836
Ninotchka,It's Ernst Lubitsch's world--we're just living in it.,836
Ninotchka,This is the cinema's lightest and sharpest appraisal of communism.,836
Ninotchka,"This is not merely a Garbo film, it is a Lubitsch film, and the result is enchanting.",836
Ninotchka,"The romantic roundelay, linking fine emotions with fine lingerie, is shadowed by the brutality of Soviet tyranny.",836
Meet John Doe,"Cooper and Stanwyck are entirely watchable, even if the plot grows artistically flagrant and thematically hollow, culminating in a final media ruse that is thoroughly farfetched.",837
Meet John Doe,Frank Capra was fond of speeches - and Meet John Doe is stuffed with them.,837
Meet John Doe,Meet John Doe is perhaps Capra's most self-reflective film.,837
Meet John Doe,A smooth. Capracareful film replete with social preachment and a magnificent portrayal by Gary Cooper.,837
Meet John Doe,"The movie is superb, dynamic, masterful. [Full review in Spanish]",837
Meet John Doe,"Like Stewart's Mr. Smith, Gary Cooper's acting choices, while more subtle than Stewart, deeply connect you with his character's plight and therefore solidly hook you into hopes for his happy ending, his redemption.",837
Meet John Doe,It's a stronger and far less dated film than his overpraised It's a Wonderful Life.,837
Meet John Doe,"[VIDEO ESSAY] Wikipedia lists ""Meet John Doe"" as an ""American comedy film."" How wrong they are.",837
Meet John Doe,"Journalistic ethics are only a small aspect of the film, but the implications are long-ranging.",837

"Glimmer Man, The",Seagal gives us a fairly good Bruce Lee impression in a film that is more moronic than it should be.,841
"Glimmer Man, The",John Gray's The Glimmer Man is strictly for Steven Seagal fans (if there is such a species).,841
"Glimmer Man, The","Although this slick Seagal action pic won't convert die-hard detractors, aficionados will note that he's both gained weight and lightened up.",841

"Glimmer Man, The","The plot of The Glimmer Man involves not only the Family Man but Our Evil Secret Government, the Russian Mafia and Rich Powerful Politicians -- the three stooges of action cinema in the '90s.",841
"Glimmer Man, The","Most of the action scenes occur in the dark and are so heavily edited, it's hard to know whose limbs and faces are being splintered by Cole.",841
"Glimmer Man, The","All-in-all, what we have here is 'classic' Seagal. And that means, for anyone who isn't an admitted fan, an uninspired outing.",841
"Glimmer Man, The","It's ugly and unpleasant but you may find it intensely compelling, much like a visit to the oral surgeon.",841
Pollyanna,Eleanor H. Porter's 1913 best-seller about a relentlessly cheerful little girl has been turned into an astonishingly pleasant movie under Walt Disney's supervision.,842
Pollyanna,Hayley Mills is tremendous in the role.,842
Pollyanna,This is Disney at its finest.,842
Pollyanna,Pollyanna emerges on the wide screen as the best live-actor movie Disney has ever made: a Niagara of drivel and a masterpiece of smarm.,842
Pollyanna,"Hayley Mills' work more than compensates for the film's lack of tautness and, at certain points, what seems to be an uncertain sense of direction.",842
Pollyanna,Heartwarming period coming-of-age tale with typical Disney gloss,842
Pollyanna,One of Disney's best 1960's films...and one of Hayley's best.,842

"Shaggy Dog, The",Nothing more than a mangy mutt.,843

"Shaggy Dog, The",full review in Greek,843
"Shaggy Dog, The","A good-natured, sometimes silly family fun that will play especially well with the under-13 set.",843
"Shaggy Dog, The","...better than one might've expected, primarily due to the enthusiasm with which Allen tackles his role...",843
"Shaggy Dog, The","At least Fred MacMurray had the good sense to let the co-star playing his son turn into a dog. But this is a Tim Allen picture, so he does the honors himself.",843
"Shaggy Dog, The",The film just translates the basic idea for a new generation under the ill-conceived notion that it was necessary.,843
"Shaggy Dog, The","Five writers (Cormac Wibberley, Marianne Wibberley, Geoff Rodkey, Jack Amiel and Michael Begler) threw everything they could think of against the wall, hoping some of it would stick, but nothing did.",843
"Shaggy Dog, The",It's an underestimation of the intelligence of your average eight year old to believe his or her rapt attention can be held for long by a film like this.,843
Freeway,A black comedy exploitation film with far more social commentary than expected. Sutherland and Witherspoon are magnetic and you wish they would interact more.,844
Freeway,Matthew Bright's Freeway is an intentionally offensive and hilarious update of Little Red Riding Hood with a tour de force performance from a pre-fame Reese Witherspoon.,844
Freeway,Not for the faint hearted but should have been much bigger than it was.,844
Freeway,"Freeway is far from a perfect film but well worth seeing, even for those who don't count themselves as fans of Witherspoon.",844
Freeway,"The greatness of [Matthew] Bright's storytelling lies in his sympathy and admiration for his characters, especially his Red Riding Hood.",844
Freeway,"Darkly humorous, witty and nasty, Freeway is an original take on the Red Riding Hood fairytale, featuring a wonderful performance by the teenage Reese Witherspoon, before she became a star",844
Freeway,"[The] characters are crisp and fascinating, and the movie has a great anything-can-happen B-movie excitement feel to it.",844

Freeway,"One of the most stubbornly original and electrifying films not only of 1996, but of the '90s, period.",844
Freeway,"There's not much edification in store, and [director] Bright cruises over some bumpy plot holes, but the teen's perspective does put a black comic spotlight on wider social hypocrisies.",844
That Thing You Do!,"For a film about rivalry, recriminations, and the allure of success, That Thing You Do! is a sweet, charming, humorous look at how far people are willing to go for success and how difficult it is to attain while maintaining the purity of your true self.",845
That Thing You Do!,"A nostalgic, whistle-clean comedy about a (fictional) band like the dozens of other nice-boy bands that cropped up after The Beatles.",845
That Thing You Do!,"...a persistently entertaining endeavor that's been suffused with a whole host of appealing, captivating elements...",845
That Thing You Do!,Hanks gives us a rocking musical film for the ages in That Thing You Do!,845
That Thing You Do!,"The chief wonder of this rock 'n' roll cast is Tom Everett Scott, whose easy charisma, dreamy smile and undersurface intelligence should shoot him up the acting charts like a bullet.",845

That Thing You Do!,Call it a sanitized version of The Commitments.,845

That Thing You Do!,"Sweet, sleepy take on flash-in-the-pan '60s band.",845
That Thing You Do!,A movie as catchy and likable as the title song.,845

To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday,"Michelle Pfeiffer is appropriately cast as a ghost, but this meditation on death and remembrance is curiously spiritless.",846
To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday,The movie lurches to its sentimental conclusion via several dead-end plot ideas that are introduced but not developed.,846

"Murder, My Sweet","It enjoys dark atmospheres and the presence of Dick Powell as the cynical detective, but its irregular rhythm leads it through predictable areas that take away the impact hook of the mystery about necklace, suspicion and murder. [Full review in Spanish]",848
"Murder, My Sweet",The dialogue is the most interesting and unique aspect of this tough-as-nails thriller: film noir talk is like a language all its own.,848
"Murder, My Sweet","Murder, My Sweet (1944) was to be released with the original title of its literary source, writer Raymond Chandler's 1940 novel Farewell, My Lovely, although it was changed so that fans of 30s song-and-dance star Dick Powell...",848

"Murder, My Sweet",Powell is glib and great in one of the best hard boilers ever.,848
"Murder, My Sweet","Any way you look at it, 1944 was a great year for fans of Raymond Chandler and film noir.",848

"Murder, My Sweet",Possibly the best attempt at bring Raymond Chandler to the screen.,848
Days of Thunder,Some members of the audience I attended for Days of Thunder snickered at the mythologizing of the young actor on the screen. Tom Cruise would be wise to pay heed to such derision.,849
Days of Thunder,"There is some interest to be mined from Days of Thunder as an auteur piece--the auteur being Cruise, not Scott.",849
Days of Thunder,"A vanity piece for Tom Cruise, who makes sure that he looks even prettier than co-star Nicole Kidman.",849
Days of Thunder,The most awesome technical feat of Days of Thunder's massive gadgetry is Cruise in close-up.,849
Days of Thunder,"For race car enthusiasts, Days of Thunder is a treat with great action scenes.",849
Days of Thunder,"The only historically noteworthy thing about this big, dumb testosterone fantasy is the first screen teaming of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.",849
Days of Thunder,"[It] was not so much about innovation and originality as it was about recycling the same themes about the glories of victory and the triumph of professionalism, which Days of Thunder produces in droves, but without any real impact.",849
Days of Thunder,The most daring thing about his cat-and-mouse game with Kidman is how erotic Noyce makes it.,849
Days of Thunder,A Formula One stock car racing flick that's formulaic and cliche-ridden.,849
Days of Thunder,"'90s race-car blockbuster has sexism, profanity.",849

"Perfect Candidate, A",What fun it is to watch.,850
"Perfect Candidate, A","Shrewd, involving",850
"Perfect Candidate, A",Plays more like the satirical Bob Roberts than a documentary,850
"Perfect Candidate, A","The film dwells a bit too much on North's unpleasant campaign strategist, Mark Goodin.",850
"Perfect Candidate, A","Personalities are being sold, not parties or philosophies, and A Perfect Candidate makes that process even more interesting because one candidate, Robb, apparently has no personality at all, while the other, North, has two.",850
"Perfect Candidate, A","It's quite a revealing, amusing and ultimately dispiriting trip",850
"Perfect Candidate, A","The film fails as a portrait of a man. But as an insider's look at a Senate campaign, it holds interest.",850
"Perfect Candidate, A","Fascinating, if more than a little depressing",850
Two or Three Things I Know About Her,"Godard forswears the forces of sympathy and audi¬ ence participation, which are perhaps forms of fear, but this does not keep him from a furious pity and expressiveness.",851
Two or Three Things I Know About Her,"Though the film's intention is clear, it doesn't hinder its poetry. [Full review in Spanish]",851
Two or Three Things I Know About Her,Godard forces the audience to engage with film as a medium purely on his terms. It's an uncomfortable yet deeply satisfying exercise.,851
Two or Three Things I Know About Her,"The pinnacle of Godard's art. Probing, uncertain, hesitant, humble, lyrical and profound",851
Two or Three Things I Know About Her,"a wide-ranging cinematic essay that may seem scattershot and abstract on first viewing, but rewards more and more with each repeated experience",851
Two or Three Things I Know About Her,"From now on, Godard's films will become film essays and then cine-tracts. 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her is the dividing line.",851

Two or Three Things I Know About Her,The dualities that abound in Jean-Luc Godard's 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her are ubiquitous at whatever starting point one chooses.,851

Two or Three Things I Know About Her,Une russite esthtique aussi improbable qu'absolue rvlant une fois de plus les immenses talents de manipulateur de foule de Godard,851
"Bloody Child, The",...boredom and small talk make the site of a violent crime no less casual a space than a pool hall.,852
"Bloody Child, The","Nina Menkes' most powerful film to date is at once an exploration of a specific murder and a meditation on violence, gender, and power.",852
"Bloody Child, The",An amazingly strange film ...,852
Braindead,A film so excessively gory that it makes the Pacino version of Scarface look like a vintage episode of Reading Rainbow by comparison.,853
Braindead,"Dead Alive has killer effects and eccentric hilarity, and it thrives through Jackson's passion. This is a must-see for any horror-comedy fan.",853
Braindead,"Made with extraordinary, obvious joy by a filmmaking team besotted with the idea of making a movie.",853
Braindead,Dead Alive is a grisly but absurd romp that you definitely shouldn't watch while eating dinner.,853
Braindead,"Sensational grotesqueries lend to an intricately orchestrated, wondrously choreographed bloodbath that is one of the funniest - and most fun - of all horror flicks.",853
Braindead,I feel like Dead Alive is telling the definitive anti-co-dependency tale.,853
Braindead,"[O]nce Lionel stops trying to cover up the zombie threat and starts fighting it, Dead Alive becomes a delirious showcase for molds, squibs, and other old-fashioned horror effects.",853
Braindead,"Paired with some truly inventive effects (especially considering the budget), plenty of blood splatter and monster mayhem, Dead Alive is cult treat that continues to deliver nearly 20 years later.",853
Braindead,The film was capable enough to treat the zombie genre with humor as well as respect. [Full Review in Spanish],853
Braindead,"Whether you're laughing too hard or whether you're just plain disgusted, Dead Alive will have you doubled over in one way or another.",853
Bad Taste,"The title says it all so, be warned, those of a sensitive nature.",854
Bad Taste,"A climatic rebirth-by-chainsaw scene almost makes it all worthwhile, though you may have had to visit the bathroom once or twice in the wait.",854
Bad Taste,"Divertido em seu humor descompromissado, este trash faz rir, mas no oferece o menor indcio do virtuoso cineasta que Jackson se tornaria.",854
Bad Taste,"I miss Peter Jackson in his ultra low-budget horror mode. He always looked like he was having fun. Not half as good as Dead Alive, but still a hoot.",854
Bad Taste,"Jackson does it all in this movie: writes, directs, stars, produces, and designs the makeup.",854
Bad Taste,"Fun, though the title couldn't be more apt.",854
Bad Taste,It certainly makes good on its title.,854
Bad Taste,"The Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson's debut is rather aptly named. Its crudity has more to do with Sam Raimi than Tolkein, but there's a wonderfully sophomoric enthusiasm that keeps it interesting.",854
Bad Taste,It warms the heart to know that the creator of this insanity went on to win the Oscar.,854
Bad Taste,"[Bad Taste will] probably work best when watched with an enthusiastic group, and a copious amount of alcohol on standby.",854
Night on Earth,"An entertaining mixed bag. It may be weak on plot, but the characters are memorable.",856

Night on Earth,"As expected, the quality of the individual vignettes varies, though only one is an out-and-out drag.",856
Night on Earth,"Funny, penetrating, zany and sad film.",856
Night on Earth,"Throughout, Jim Jarmusch playfully blurs the line between driver/passenger, servant/customer, and native/immigrant.",856
Night on Earth,Takes us to places most other filmmakers never do.,856
Night on Earth,Jarmusch's most accessible exercise to date while also his least seen,856
Night on Earth,"Revisiting his interest in oblique comedy, Jarmusch explores a primal relationship, that of a passenger and taxi driver, using the cab as a temporary shared world, from which one party may emerge shaken up or feeling differently about himself/herself",856
Night on Earth,"Though it may take a while to get Jarmusch's gist, hang in there; by the time Tom Waits growls his lovely closing waltz over the credits, Jarmusch has shown us moments most filmmakers don't even notice.",856
Night on Earth,"Almost good, but not quite there.",856
Paris Was a Woman,A must-see for lesbian history fanatics.,857
Amityville: Dollhouse,"I really think that if this wasn’t an Amityville film, it would be better regarded as a cult film.",858
Amityville: Dollhouse,"Amityville: Dollhouse adopts the same format as the last few films without contributing much new to the mix...There are some fun moments here, but overall, this entry feels the least inspired of the eight.",858
April Fool's Day,"The film is an ingenious stab at satirical horror, made well before self-awareness was so widespread in the genre.",859

April Fool's Day,April Fool's Day is not the best slasher but is far from the worst. It's a clever and fresh take on not only an oversaturated genre but also an intriguing take on one of the most fool-hearted days of the year.,859
April Fool's Day,"...familiar territory that is, for the most part, employed to hopelessly (and pervasively) underwhelming effect...",859
April Fool's Day,It's amazing how successful a slasher movie can be when you actually like the characters and they're all mostly fleshed out.,859
April Fool's Day,"Updating the famous Agatha Christie tale with adolescent tricks, sexual innuendo, wrestling under the bedsheets, and bloody violence, the film maintains moderate interest.",859
April Fool's Day,"What it may lack in an official body count, April Fool's Day more than makes up for with its whip-smart script, charismatic performances, and a whopper of an ending that I certainly wasn't expecting at all the first time I saw it.",859
April Fool's Day,Basically a Brat Pack slasher flick.,859
April Fool's Day,"If you favor horror satires that deconstruct the mechanics of the genre, like 'Behind the Mask' or 'Scream,' ['April Fool's Day' stings with originality and fun].",859
April Fool's Day,The suspense sequences are stylishly managed...,859
Nosferatu a Venezia,the film is (...) a haunting vision of a floating underworld of rotten opulence that manages to walk the razor’s edge between art and schlock.,861
Nosferatu a Venezia,"Nosferatu in Venice is an unholy mess. It's also oddly watchable, if only to see fine actors trapped in impossible situations.",861
Jingle All the Way,"At the end of the day, Jingle All the Way is a holiday classic that kids can take good lessons from, and adults will be able to at least laugh at a bit",862
Jingle All the Way,Schwarzenegger's charisma helps somewhat. [Full review in Spanish],862
Jingle All the Way,...the movie benefits substantially from Schwarzenegger's go-for-broke turn as the progressively frantic central character...,862
Jingle All the Way,That rare family-themed Christmas movie that isn't really aimed at kids. It's actually aimed at adults... It's a family Christmas movie that's completely honest about what family Christmases tend to be like!,862
Jingle All the Way,Watching Arnold Schwarzenegger take a stab at light-hearted comedy is often like watching a whale try to maintain its balance on a gymnastics beam.,862
Jingle All the Way,"Regardless of how crazy it was, it is actually still entertaining. You can't help but laugh at some of the madness. Pure madness.",862
Jingle All the Way,"I have a soft spot for it, because I saw it so many times as a kid, but this is not a good movie.",862
Jingle All the Way,"The film is very loud, and festooned with the sort of comic violence far more disturbing than anything in an 18-rated movie.",862
Jingle All the Way,Ahnold terminates the holiday spirit.,862
Jingle All the Way,"Of course, the kid will eventually realize that fatherly love means more than money (if forced to choose), and that he has the real Last Action Figure in good ol' Dad.",862
"Garden of Finzi-Contini, The","This is not one of those worthless, ponderous pieces of arthouse twaddle but I would never enthusiastically recommend it to anybody. There are far better European dramas about the Holocaust that are emotionally involving as well as being solidly crafted.",863
"Garden of Finzi-Contini, The","An achingly beautiful cautionary tale about the blindness of privilege, a movie rich with longing and loss.",863
"Garden of Finzi-Contini, The","For its story moment before the gathering storm broke, this film is a garden wall held up, a finger in the dyke, just before the deluge and fall into darkness.",863
"Garden of Finzi-Contini, The","A powerful, poignant look at the fall of an ideal -- a last-ditch effort to find pleasure and happiness in the face of impending terror.",863

"Garden of Finzi-Contini, The",a highly effective piece of work by an always interesting and thoughtful filmmaker,863
My Fellow Americans,"With two of the screen's best comedic actors, a script that crackles with wit and surprise, and perfectly tuned direction, My Fellow Americans scores a bull's-eye.",864
My Fellow Americans,My Fellow Americans certainly holds up after several presidential administrations but the film could definitely be better.,864
My Fellow Americans,"The humor is clearly of the lowbrow variety, but Lemmon and Garner handle their lines with the conviction of Royal Shakespeare Company members tackling Macbeth.",864
My Fellow Americans,"If My Fellow Americans had ever decided which movie it wanted to be, it might have been pretty good. As it is, the good half and the bad half all but cancel each other out.",864
My Fellow Americans,"Using talent of this order on a script this weak, along with merely decorative appearances by the likes of Lauren Bacall and Wilford Brimley, amounts to the Hollywood equivalent of government waste.",864
My Fellow Americans,If only movies could be impeached.,864
My Fellow Americans,"Mostly, My Fellow Americans is solidly written, offbeat entertainment well-served by the fine leads, clever casting of supporting roles and a script that holds together, even through a less-than-stellar finale.",864
My Fellow Americans,"As political satire, My Fellow Americans makes a poor candidate.",864
My Fellow Americans,The surprise of this comedy... is how sharply written it is -- almost sharply enough to overcome the crude direction that grotesquely overemphasizes the picture's inevitable sentimental interludes.,864
My Fellow Americans,"Yes, it's Grumpy Old Presidents, in which most of the comedy comes from the supposed shock of hearing two senior citizens cursing at each other in terms Beavis and Butt-head would find inelegant.",864
"Ice Storm, The","Even while nailing a specific period in time, it’s still able to transcend its setting and speak directly to modern folks who no longer find aesthetic pleasure in impossibly long sideburns.",865
"Ice Storm, The","In fact, just about everything sexual that happens in the film is dirty, unpleasant, unsatisfying, and led to pain and heartbreak for just about everyone involved (25th anniversary)",865
"Ice Storm, The","The Ice Storm contains a deeply human authenticity and willingness to portray, but not resolve, its characters' collective alienation.",865
"Ice Storm, The",Family life -- the real focus of The Ice Storm -- is rendered as having something like the alienating density of prison; each solitary feels enclosed in his or her own sentence and injustice.,865
"Ice Storm, The",The film's smartly told through the eyes of the children...,865
"Ice Storm, The","The key to The Ice Storm's ambiguity and unexpected depth is that the events of the story mean wholly different things to different characters -- there's no moral, just life sliced like a loaf of bread.",865
"Ice Storm, The","Elegantly directed by Sense and Sensibility's Ang Lee, it frames the moral vacuity of the Seventies with cool, contemporary hindsight.",865
"Ice Storm, The","Nothing less than one of the year's best pictures, a portrait of wealthy Connecticut suburbanites in the 1970s whose lives have no emotional or spiritual rudder.",865
"Ice Storm, The","The Ice Storm captures this place, this season, this garish and confused moment in history, with surgical precision...It's Lee's sympathetic detachment that gives the movie its paradoxical power.",865
"Ice Storm, The","Among its many virtues, 'The Ice Storm' keenly captures the sheer, visceral terror of puberty-of grappling with these urges, trying to do what you think you're supposed to, and lashing out when you can't.",865
Michael,"Michael Clayton has an important story to tell, but is sometimes overly stifling in its stuffy pretenses.",866
Michael,"There is a lot to admire in [Michael Clayton] regarding corruption and personal responsibility. You may, however, want to cut out before [the end].",866

Michael,Michael Clayton is a legal suspense thriller that manages to get our attention from the very moment that the picture appears on the screen.,866
Michael,"The deeper you get into ""Clayton,"" the more it becomes apparent that this is a masterful character study of how people react when pushed to the brink.",866
Michael,"A deliberately paced, endlessly riveting, highly suspenseful work that captivates and thrills with an assured hand.",866
Michael,"The storytelling is so good I simply got caught up, and, as for George, he is seriously, seriously good... Here, his performance is passionate, subtle and right on the money.",866
"Whole Wide World, The",I felt like I was watching two different movies.,867
"Whole Wide World, The","It adroitly conveys author Robert E. Howard's slow disconnect from the world, and the effect that had on those around him.",867
"Whole Wide World, The","""well-acted and moving""",867

Hearts and Minds,Hearts and Minds is a difficult and powerful anti-war documentary which depicts horrific events as well as cataloguing equally disgusting attitudes.,868
Hearts and Minds,"Hearts and Minds remains a brutal, eye opening piece that mixes 60s style direct cinema with honest and balanced interviews columnating in a work of activist non-fiction that falls unapologetically in the anti-war camp.",868
Hearts and Minds,Though you could accuse the film of being heavy-handed... it's impossible not to feel its punch to the gut.,868
Hearts and Minds,"The faces, intonations, backgrounds of Hearts and Minds -- even its small gestures and sometimes very long pauses -- speak as eloquently as its words.",868
Hearts and Minds,"Throughout, Hearts and Minds displays more than enough heart. It is mind that is missing.",868
Hearts and Minds,"It operates to arouse hatred against hatred, to induce a gut reaction against gut reactions, and by so doing serves to sustain a morbid emotionalism of the very sort it claims to abominate.",868

Fools Rush In,Shows how love leads away from reason into the mysteries of the heart.,869
Fools Rush In,"Stick to the sitcoms, Matt.",869

Touch,We become caught up in Kristófer’s efforts to find the woman who has remained lodged in his heart for the past 50 years while his adult life has played itself out.,870
Touch,"Touch is an absorbing, touching and simply lovely drama. And one of the year’s best? Yeah, maybe.",870
Touch,One of the most beautiful films that you will see this year. Captures the emotions of love and loss in a way that very few films have been able to do over the years.,870
Touch,"There's a real tenderness to Touch, a bittersweet quality that derives from an overriding feeling of nostalgia and that sense that memories can be both beautiful and painful, at the same time.",870
Touch,"The film prioritises the nostalgic reminiscences of [the protagonist's] first love. During these moments, Touch captures moments of genuine warmth and youthful passion. But elsewhere the film proves hollow and reductive.",870
Touch,"Is there something worse than loving someone and losing them for five decades? Yes, there is. This film about two people who leave an irreversible touch on each other brought tears to my eyes.",870
Touch,Miko’s emotional story unfolds in a way that is itself as gentle and profound as a Japanese Haiku.,870
Touch,Touch is an uncommonly poignant drama that balances rich sentimentality with more harrowing themes. Only cynics will resist a swoon or three.,870
Touch,"An old-school weepie smothered in a syrupy string score, Touch is an unexpected offering from Icelandic action director Kormákur, who has made his name pitting humans against nature: the Himalayas in Everest, the sea in Adrift, a rogue lion in Beast.",870
Touch,"Though undeniably predictable in terms of premise, structure and final outcome, this exquisitely produced and acted affair just does not put a foot wrong as it gently lures you towards its misty-eyed destination.",870

Vegas Vacation,"This was okay; nothing special, kind of amusing.",871
Vegas Vacation,You'd be wise not to gamble on this.,871

Love Jones,"""Love Jones"" is so pretty to look at -- and listen to -- that its moldy story hardly matters.",872
Love Jones,"The question that comes to mind while watching ""love jones"" is, ""What took Hollywood so long to make a film like this?""",872
Love Jones,"Witcher makes a remarkably confident filmmaking debut, eliciting excellent performances from his leads and underscoring their romance with a soundtrack that flavors, rather than overwhelms, the story.",872
Love Jones,"For a movie with so much talk, it has little to say. Love, we learn, is not easy. Point well taken. But most of us have found that out for ourselves.",872
Love Jones,"It certainly doesn’t hurt that Witcher has assembled a cast that is easy on the viewers’ eyes; a handsome lot of players who speak as hip as they dress, and strut, sulk, and flirt around the scenery with elegance.",872
Love Jones,"Starring budding luminaries such as Larenz Tate, Nia Long and Isaiah Washington, the power of Witcher’s film lies in its intelligence and simplicity -- a well-written, beautifully presented snap shot of 1990s Chicago.",872
Love Jones,"An eloquent and underseen ensemble dramedy, Love Jones receives a sparkling 4K transfer and a hearty helping of extras from the Criterion Collection.",872
Love Jones,One of those films which grows in stature the more you think about it.,872
Love Jones,"We've seen this plot often before but it is something of an indictment of the movie industry that we haven't seen it played, at least not often, by black actors.",872
Love Jones,"The central romance is one you can get behind, the ultra-attractive leads are fine fantasy figures, and the world they inhabit is a seductive one in which it’s a pleasure to spend time.",872

Picture Perfect,enjoyable fluff,873
Picture Perfect,"Sure, the movie follows a basic romantic comedy formula, but it has a freshness about it, mainly because Aniston and Mohr make a sweet match.",873
Picture Perfect,"The characters are one-dimensional and surprisingly shallow, the film is unpleasantly predictable, and the realism factor here is You've gotta be kidding.",873
Picture Perfect,"[Aniston] at her best can recall young Barbra Streisand in her What's Up, Doc? days.",873
Picture Perfect,"The main thing that makes it watchable are the performances of Jennifer Aniston, Jay Mohr and Kevin Bacon. The three make an interesting romantic triangle, despite numerous plot problems, such as the story is basically unbelievable.",873
Picture Perfect,"Not quite bad enough to call rancid, and that's the best I can say for it.",873
Picture Perfect,"The comedy side of the formula gets short shrift here, partly because the camera spends so much time lingering on Ms. Aniston's ineffable cuteness.",873
Career Girls,"Career Girls is a different kind of Leigh film, not only for the division of its themes but also for the formal ways in which the director balances them.",874
Career Girls,"It manages to be uninteresting, slight and bleak, while desperately trying to find something to say about the human condition.",874

Washington Square,"Not even the usually twinkle-eyed Maggie Smith, here playing Catherine's aunt, can buoy the material.",882
Washington Square,"If you are going to have an appealing Townsend you may as well have a distinctive Catherine. When they are sitting side by side playing piano duets, or kissing passionately in the parlor while the doctor is out, they make believable lovers.",882
Washington Square,"Holland's passionate version may be truer to James. He'd be startled by its earthiness, but he'd recognize these bruised, complex hearts as his own.",882
Washington Square,"Jennifer Jason Leigh shows a surprising flair for modest, introspective moods in Agnieszka Holland's deftly directed adaptation of Henry James's quietly compassionate novel.",882

Washington Square,"Guys, go see this movie (the first half) to find out how to treat a lady. My friend wanted to borrow my notebook and make notes for himself.",882
Washington Square,"Henry James saw more humor in the story than Holland does (although Aunt Lavinia remains comic), but what they both understand is that in a family such as this, everything depends on the money -- unless nothing does.",882
Washington Square,"With her usual abandon, Leigh at first loses herself in Catherine's gaudy dresses and nervous tics. As the story progresses, however, the actress lets us see there is considerably more going on with this girl than first meets the eye.",882

Year of the Horse,"This is an intimate, lyrical yet incendiary film, and it will please fans of both Young and Jarmusch.",884
Year of the Horse,"It cuts right to the savage heart of it all, thrusting the music center stage and leaving the rumors and anecdotes (most of them, anyway) to the biographers.",884
Year of the Horse,This is quite possibly the worst documentary I have ever had the displeasure of watching on the big screen.,884

Eve's Bayou,"In 1997, Roger Ebert named it the best film of the year. In 2018, the Library of Congress added it to the National Film Registry...and yet the film, which made back its cost nearly five times over, received zero Oscar nominations. Go figure.",887
Eve's Bayou,"Twenty-five years ago, Kasi Lemmons made her feature directorial debut with Eve’s Bayou, a steamy family drama as steeped in hidden dangers as its 1960s rural Louisiana setting, starring a who’s who of Black cinema.",887
Eve's Bayou,"Eve’s Bayou tells a painful story that is hard to recover from, especially for the family it impacted. Kasi Lemmons conceived, formulated, and accomplished a special film that would not be forgotten.",887
Eve's Bayou,"both complex and engaging, drawing us into the smoldering, simmering world of the Batiste family and their twisted dynamics without turning them into Gothic grotesquerie",887
Eve's Bayou,"Mixing in Creole voodoo adds karma and revelation to dark secrets beyond infidelity, making such a stirring film with Samuel L. Jackson as the father...",887
Eve's Bayou,"Lemmons also does a stunning job of relaying a memory to us. She places the characters right back into the scene playing in their mind's eye. They narrate it as they witness it, blow by blow. But as we see, things aren't always what they appear to be.",887
Eve's Bayou,"[Lemmons's] creativity and the breadth of her vision more than make up for her occasional missteps, luring us into a family album of secrets and lies that keeps the audience groping along with this fine ensemble cast for the truths buried in murky waters.",887
Eve's Bayou,"An astonishingly accomplished first feature by Kasi Lemmons, this poetic and achingly perceptive film deserves a place on any number of year-end ""best"" lists.",887
Eve's Bayou,"The expressivity of the filmmaking doesn't quite measure up to the ideas and feelings that inspired Eve's Bavott. That said, this is still a wonderfully talented and intelligent film.",887
Eve's Bayou,"The visually sumptuous and morally ambiguous Eve's Bayou possesses a strong sense of time and place, and makes for an auspicious first effort by actress-turned-writer/director Kasi Lemmons.",887
One Night Stand,Genuine performances make this talky romantic drama almost worth watching.,888
"Tango Lesson, The","Potter dances very well, but acts her scenes with the vacant half-smile of someone kidnapped by Moonies and force-fed Prozac.",889

Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,"I barely managed to make it through Mortal Kombat Annihilation because the dialog is terrible, the story makes no sense and the kung fu action scenes are substandard.",890
Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,"A critical and commercial fatality, this fantasy action-adventure flopped so hard it sent its characters back to their original, video-game realm until a 2021 live-action reboot.",890
Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,The climax devolves into a mess of pitiful CG animalities - video game finishing moves that definitely shouldn't have been translated into the realm of cinema.,890
Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,Here's the lowdown on the latest chapter in Mortal Kombat: deadly dull.,890
Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,The makers of the thoroughly terrible Mortal Kombat: Annihilation haven't even attempted to move beyond their source material -- the super-popular video game -- and actually make a movie.,890
Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,"Take the worst elements of martial arts movies, the worst elements of science fiction movies... and the cheesiest sets and special effects this side of Ed Wood. Mix them together and you have something called Mortal Kombat Annihilation.",890
Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is not just a movie based on a video game, it is a sequel to a movie that was based on a video game. That pedigree should tell you all you need to know about the quality of this movie.",890
Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,The sequel to the 1995 live-action video-game movie turns out to be idiotic but amusing low kitsch.,890
Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,"The filmmakers tried to get complicated -- and pay a price. The story lines are obviously designed to link the fight scenes, leading to moments of hilariously bad dialogue.",890
Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is doubly insulting; a shamelessly lazy sequel and embarrassingly low-effort video game adaptation.,890
Bent,"Bent is... the Karl Urban Show, a delightful excuse to showcase just how potent the performer is as a leading man.",891
Bent,"Perhaps Moresco is a great salesman, or maybe the talent just wants to work. Either way, the movie doesn't ask much of their talents, wasting time on forgettable material.",891
Bent,"One wonders what drew talented writer-director Bobby Moresco, the Oscar-winning co-scripter of ""Crash,"" to such uninspired material.",891
Flubber,Replaces the original's audience-pleasing sweetness with an audiences-are-suckers cynicism.,892
Flubber,Kids should take to it like Jell-O pudding.,892
Flubber,"How you could have a proven script, a star with the kinetic improvisational genius of Robin Williams and the best computer-generated effects money can buy and still have created a movie this dull is mind-boggling.",892
Flubber,"Kids may be amused, but there is nothing here for an adult. Just another example of how special effects have ruined Hollywood.",892
Flubber,...a particularly ineffective Disney reboot that wastes the talent of its cast and crew.,892
Flubber,"Disney's remake of 1961's The Absent-Minded Professor is a graceless, lifeless, slapstick jamboree.",892
Flubber,"A cute, well-meaning, but ultimately disappointing movie. Williams, an enormously busy actor these days, seems tired here--and so does a lot of the slapstick.",892
Flubber,Robin Williams is given no room to stretch. He's stuck mooning over a romance that will bore youngsters.,892
Flubber,Many kids will enjoy this silly movie.,892
Flubber,The new version is a total dud.,892
For Richer or Poorer,It's a see-through comedy with an easily-called plot line but Allen and Alley's attempt to blend into the austere Amish lifestyle is mostly syrup-free fun.,893
For Richer or Poorer,"Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley show their customary skill with comedy, but they can not overcome the ho-hum directing and script.",893
For Richer or Poorer,"Despite its Amish setting, this laborious comedy proves to be witless rather than Witness.",893
For Richer or Poorer,Neither [Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley] nor the competent cast can overcome the formulaic script by Jana Howington and Steve Lukanic or the humdrum direction by Bryant Spicer.,893
For Richer or Poorer,Kirstie Alley and Tim Allen are shallow New York socialites on the verge of divorce who become tax-fraud fugitives and pretend to be simple Amish folk. Eva Gabor and Eddie Albert they're not.,893
For Richer or Poorer,"I wish Tim Allen would go back to cocaine and stop making movies. In fact, the good of the world demands it.",893
For Richer or Poorer,"Not a terrible romantic comedy. The Amish stuff has been done before, there are some moments in here.",893
For Richer or Poorer,"No masterpiece, but it does have heart",893
For Richer or Poorer,It's a see-through comedy with an easily-called plot line but Allen and Alley's attempt to blend into the austere Amish lifestyle is mostly syrup-free fun.,893
For Richer or Poorer,"Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley show their customary skill with comedy, but they can not overcome the ho-hum directing and script.",893
Home Alone 3,"This slapstick schtick is slickly delivered and for a well-worn plot, the fun is airy and the stunts at the expense of the bad guys are often very funny.",894
Home Alone 3,"No surprises here as far as the plot, just changes in casting keep this sequel lively.",894
Home Alone 3,[John Hughes] figures he didn't need any surprises: Just take the blueprint for the first of the series and slip it in the copying machine.,894
Home Alone 3,"Twice the bad guys, half the laughs.",894
Home Alone 3,"There are some genuine laughs, and not too much saccharin or cartoon-style brutality.",894
Home Alone 3,Formulaic movie draws some laughs from pratfalls.,894
Home Alone 3,"Until the next stupid movie that nobody wants to review comes along, this is Coal Dog. Courage.",894
Home Alone 3,"A refreshing, bubbly follow-on",894
Home Alone 3,The third time is definitely not a charm for this recycled ruse of cartoonish high jinks involving another rambunctious rascal up to no good. Pointless and ponderous.,894
Home Alone 3,"further proof --as if any were needed-- that John Hughes-scripted movies are now a thing to be feared instead of anticipated, as they might have been ten years ago during his 'Breakfast Club'/'Planes, Trains and Automobiles'/'Pretty in Pink' heyday.",894
Scream 2,"Wes Craven is a master craftsman and Scream 2 is satisfyingly filled with red herrings, suspense, and lots of slashing.",895
Scream 2,"While the movie stands on its own, it's a giddier experience if you're familiar with the original.",895
Scream 2,This copy-cat plot has little of the fun of Scream and a lot of dull slash and chase scenes.,895
Scream 2,"If Scream (1996) opens with one of horror’s most iconic scenes, the sequel features a pre-credits sequence that, like its predecessor, is better than the film that follows it.",895
Scream 2,This sequel to the highly successful original is wittier and just as scary.,895
Scream 2,Superior to the overrated original. A couple of set-pieces attempt to accentuate suspense rather than slaughter.,895
Scream 2,"As sequels go, Scream 2 is a cut above the rest with fresh faces, a story that keeps the viewer engaged throughout the two-hour run time.",895
Scream 2,... Williamson and Craven built a legacy of pain that makes every trial Sidney survives another bit of redemption for a mother’s broken past and makes the films far deeper than one would expect without sacrificing what makes this so damned entertaining.,895
Scream 2,"While the film does fall into place alongside many of its horror predecessors, its awareness of self and strive for continuity elevates it beyond ""just another sequel"".",895
Scream 2,"Craven almost surpasses the original Scream, a top-notch narrative that's just a bit too overstuffed for its runtime.",895

"Sweet Hereafter, The","The film works very well on its own merits combining stunning cinematography, brilliant performances and a stirring screenplay.",896

"Sweet Hereafter, The","There's a mesmerizing clarity to The Sweet Hereafter': you're moved by it, but you never feel the filmmaker is milking your emotions.",896
"Sweet Hereafter, The","That's the true power of Egoyan's film - how in shuffling the chronological deck, we see what once was in this town, both in its light and its darkness, and how none of it will ever be the same, no matter what Mitchell Stevens says.",896
"Sweet Hereafter, The",Egoyan's most successful film to date.,896
"Sweet Hereafter, The","A film that touches on the essence of love by throwing us into the abyss of loss, The Sweet Hereafter marks the apex of the English-Canadian film tradition as it navigates the empty space left in the wake of tragedy with a gentle, but unsentimental eye.",896
"Sweet Hereafter, The","In its unsparing depiction of the loneliness and despair that afflicts the tragedy-wracked town of Sam Dent, The Sweet Hereafter is one of the coldest movies ever made.",896
"Sweet Hereafter, The",Cuts to the bone and stays there long after its end credits have finished rolling.,896
"Postman, The","In synopsis, The Postman may sound like a blueprint for a Saturday Night Live comedy sketch. On screen, however, the weirdly compelling plot, taken from a novel by David Brin, is all the more affecting for being played perfectly straight.",898
"Postman, The","The Postman is probably worth a revival as a film that was laughed off the screen, but got plenty right in retrospect... a sci-fi film that’s less about machines and technology than ideas, and that’s as unfashionable now in 2024 as it was in 1997’s 2013.",898
"Postman, The","Costner the director lavishes all sorts of attention on Costner the actor, from laughably reverential dialogue (""You give out hope like it was candy in your pocket"") to loving close-ups to gauzy slow-motion montages.",898
"Postman, The","You can go with the idea of a heroic postie implausibly rallying the downtrodden, or you can have fun making fun of its awfulness.",898
"Postman, The",It's about as inspiring as a movie about a vengeful meter reader.,898
"Postman, The","Star/director Kevin Costner's futuristic folly The Postman is so loopy that, for a while, one wants to shield it from a critical storm that has already begun.",898
"Postman, The","The sweeping movement of the tale across half a continent, and the frequent action that facilitates it, is conveyed in a majestic and for the most part exciting manner.",898
"Postman, The","The film aims for an uncomfortable compromise between the dramatic sincerity of Dances with Wolves and the epic spectacle of Waterworld, but lacks the explanatory detail and narrative fluency to achieve either.",898
"Postman, The","...wasn't bad for the first two hours, but then kept going another hour",898
"Postman, The","The first half of Costner's The Postman is actually quite interesting, but it falters badly in the second half with a few unintentional howlers.",898
"Winter Guest, The","A dull, plodding exercise directed by actor Alan Rickman.",899

Kundun,Mesmerizing as visual pageantry but anemic when it comes to allowing access to this man or his religion.,900
Kundun,The effect is to make one feel as if one is seeing Tibet's recent history through the Dalai Lama's eyes.,900
Kundun,"The film is, in many ways, a remarkable achievement but also a singularly undynamic entry in the director's canon.",900
Kundun,"It's not exactly 'Goodfellas.' But it's not every filmmaker who can create works as divergent as 'Goodfellas' and 'Kundun,' either.",900
Kundun,"Vigorously directed, sensual and hypnotic, Scorsese's film is a visually extraordinary meditation on ritual, nature and humanity.",900
Kundun,"A challenging, thought provoking, mediative film that sits uncomfortably with Scorcese's previous work is helped no end by a superb score by Philip Glass.",900
Kundun,"The music ties together all the pretty pictures, gives the narrative some momentum, and helps to induce a kind of alert detachment, so that you're neither especially interested nor especially bored.",900
Kundun,"Scorsese has taken the harsh mystery out of Tibetan Buddhism, and out of its oppression, too.",900
Kundun,Scorsese's rich tableau of image and music bears a potent emotional weight.,900
Kundun,"Kundun is surely the most gentle and meditative of Scorsese's films, a placid biography with the scope of an epic, the quality of a storybook, and the dramatic stakes of a tragedy.",900

"Big Lebowski, The","It’s just one of the most original films ever made, perhaps the best world the Coens imagined and the one filled with its best characters.",902
"Big Lebowski, The",The Big Lebowski is at once utterly inconsequential and a blow for a cinematic slacker aesthetic.,902
"Big Lebowski, The","Bridge's thespian mastery, via the slacker zeitgeist of our time, converts The Dude's funniest lines into a readily-understood language of everyday desperation. This ultimately begat the religion of Dudeism. Which makes 'Lebowski' an important movie.",902
"Big Lebowski, The","25 years later, the movie where every detail matters and doesn’t matter at all, is as hilarious as ever – and more poignant, man.",902
"Big Lebowski, The","The Coen Brothers introduced the world to The Dude, Jesus, Walter, Maude, and a fantasia of burnt-out ex-hippie in a Raymond Chandler plot. (25th anniversary)",902
"Big Lebowski, The","The Dude becomes an aspirational figure, chill in the face of increasing absurdity, and ever able to express himself in perfectly quotable ways.",902
"Big Lebowski, The","With their inspired, absurdist taste for weird, peculiar Americana, the Coens have defined and mastered their own bizarre subgenre. No one does it like them and, it almost goes without saying, no one does it better.",902
"Big Lebowski, The","Leave it to Joel and Ethan Coen to wake up a drowsy movie genre with a bucket of ice water, a giant alarm clock and a fistful of No-Doz. The Big Lebowski... injects a mammoth syringe of adrenaline lunacy directly into the overdosed heart of film noir.",902
"Big Lebowski, The","In American movies, the Coens are the reigning eccentric poets of the loser class. Who else could get away with quoting Theodore Herzl in a bowling alley?",902
"Big Lebowski, The",A hilarious pop-culture hash. The Big Lebowski is the best movie ever set mostly in a bowling alley.,902
Afterglow,"Afterglow, while occasionally an entertaining movie, focuses too much on sex and not enough on character.",903
Afterglow,"The actors deliver their lines with stark and declamatory fervor, and their gestures have a sharp, sculptural stillness that's reminiscent of the grand artifices of classic-Hollywood productions.",903
Afterglow,"Like Tiffany jewels in a Woolworth setting, talented veterans Julie Christie and Nick Nolte outshine Alan Rudolph's mediocre film Afterglow.",903
Afterglow,Alan Rudolph's romantic roundelay sounds a lot more interesting than it plays.,903
Afterglow,"The still strkingly beautiful Julie Christie renders such as glowing performance that she alone justifies viewing this incurable, frivolous romantic serio-comedy in which she plays B-Movie actress!",903
Afterglow,"Christie is a revelation, a lilting, charming schemer ... She alone is reason enough to see this flawed and haunting film.",903
Afterglow,"Will turn off viewers before they arrive at scenes in the final third of this movie that make the previous, tedious parts forgivable.",903
Afterglow,"Afterglow plants a cynical seed in its provocative examination of isolation, arbitrary emotional fulfillment, and marital stagnation. Christie dutifully fills the shoes of a wounded woman so convincingly",903
Afterglow,"Both the title and the preview had a soft, succinct delicacy that appealed to me, but it turns out that what passes for winsome and tempting in a three-minute clip is only nebulous and frustrating in a full two-hour span.",903
Afterglow,"In exploring the breakdown of two marriages, Alan Rudolph returns to his anatomy of the dynamics of intimacy.",903
Ma vie en rose,"Like Ludovic, I marvel at the wonderful, magical mystery that is life. All these years later, Ma Vie en Rose remains a rapturous miracle.",904
Ma vie en rose,Has the good sense not to preach or treat its characters with frivolity. It is in the truest sense of the word a family film.,904
Ma vie en rose,"This is the sort of sweet, kind-hearted comedy Hollywood seems less and less capable of.",904

Ma vie en rose,"Credit should go foremost to du Fresne, who is great as Ludovic. It's pretty astounding how capable he is at conveying Ludovic's feelings, particularly when she's swallowing others' transphobia.",904
Ma vie en rose,"Queer movies can run adjacent to or parallel to other Queer lives, but it's rare that a movie will ever intersect with my life or even contain numerous scenes that I have personally lived. Ma Vie En Rose does that.",904

Great Expectations,"The film has a defining contemporary hipness, and features good work by Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow. But it's more a meditation on its source than a filming of it.",905
Great Expectations,Where the film fails is in its commercial proclivity to centre the narrative trajectory around a fairly asinine updating of the Pip/Estella love-match into a soppy romance.,905
Great Expectations,"Visually stunning retelling has nudity, lots of swearing.",905
Great Expectations,Cuarn and company end up throwing all the style they've got at the film... to compensate for a perpetually stalled drama.,905
Great Expectations,"In the end, shiny surfaces are just that--surfaces, with nothing necessarily underneath.",905
Great Expectations,"It's a fairly minor film, but quite lovely and successful at creating its own time and place.",905
Great Expectations,"Charles Dickens' novel has been pared to the bone and set in the present day, and the result is a beautifully shot mess. The characters' motivations could not be any less clear.",905
Great Expectations,The film's exectution is more of a tragedy than the story.,905
Great Expectations,"his film doesn't have anything to say, it just wants to make a fashion statement: Pretty people should get to do stuff other people don't get to do.",905
Great Expectations,"Sua 'moral' pode at ser simples, como em todas as fbulas, mas o processo pela qual 'ensinada' interessante - e espantosamente otimista.",905
Oscar & Lucinda,Fiennes and Blanchett have a special magic and air of giddy humor about them when they are together.,906
Oscar & Lucinda,"This is after all a Gillian Anderson picture, which means the film's physical production is just as impressive as its spiritual apsiration; Cate Blanchett, in a role originally intended for Judy Davis, is bound to become a major star",906

Half Baked,"As far as pot comedies go, it's got just enough laughs to warrant a visit.",908
Half Baked,"Winningly stupid comedy, with the emphasis on stupid.",908
Half Baked,"seems half-produced, with a grainy, unattractive look and bargain-basement special-effects that ruin some good ideas. Perhaps the filmmakers blew their budget on the slew of guest stars who pop up briefly...",908
Half Baked,The definitive stoner's anthem film. Chapelle is hilarious and charismatic. Great celebrity cameos help keep the uneven script afloat. (Best served fully baked).,908

Nil By Mouth,"Though uncompromising in its portrayal of violence, Nil by Mouth tempers its bleakness with moments of tender understanding and wounding insight; in short, it's a must-see.",910
Nil By Mouth,Years after it's release it still feels as painful as when it was released.,910
Nil By Mouth,"A dense portrait of the tiny discomfiting gestures, irritable glances and physical tics that build to a sudden eruption of bone-crushing rage.",910
Nil By Mouth,It is an urban pastoral and social-realist tragedy.,910
Nil By Mouth,"If Oldman is ever to direct again, only time will tell. Until then, “Nil By Mouth” remains as striking a film — perhaps even more so — as it was a quarter century ago.",910
Nil By Mouth,"Kathy Burke gives a brilliant, award-winning performance as Val, a woman trapped in a dysfunctional relationship with her abusive husband...",910
Nil By Mouth,"Nil By Mouth offers a harrowing look at a working-class family beset by drugs, alcohol and abuse.",910

Nil By Mouth,"Rough, tough but with an underlying generosity toward its characters... an impressive writing-helming debut cloaked in a torrent of profanity and loutish, abusive behavior.",910
Nil By Mouth,"Shot and scripted in a deceptively casual, bleakly 'realist' style, it's the closest Britain has produced to a Cassavetes film, and as such, profoundly humane.",910
Twilight,"Twilight is a designed film, with rigorous casting and a somewhat predictable script. [Full review in Spanish]",911
Twilight,"Though director Catherine Hardwicke’s movie shouldn’t be labeled unsuccessful, it’s certainly uneven.",911
Twilight,The sequels became increasingly silly and overwrought but the original Twilight (2008) is actually kind of interesting even if you are not a devotee of the fan fic-turned-bestseller series.,911
Twilight,"As someone who has loved the horror genre my whole life, Twilight pains me.",911
Twilight,"The first film grounds everything, and does a fine job of world-building; even the climactic fight scene is fully integrated into the emotional core[.]",911
Twilight,The fact that it's not completely appalling is perhaps its greatest achievement.,911
Twilight,It's critic proof.,911
Twilight,"For hopeful adolescents and hopeless romantics alike, this bizarrely quaint love story (adapted from the first of a best-selling series of books by Stephenie Meyer) will play the heartstrings like a harp.",911

Love and Death on Long Island,Hurt gives such a stirring performance that it’s hard to imagine him in any other role.,913
Love and Death on Long Island,"Hurt is a droll delight as the Oxbridge man of letters naïvely discovering America. And Priestley, playing a naïf of a different sort, is deliciously typecast as a deadpan hunk.",913

Love and Death on Long Island,Funny and unexpectedly touching.,913
Love and Death on Long Island,"A movie about an older man stalking an B-movie actor that he has become obsessed with. It is a funny, odd, and also very sad portrait of a lonely man. A very good, original movie.",913
Love and Death on Long Island,Hurt's magnificent and sensitive performance...makes the whole scenario unexpectedly poignant and sweetly sad.,913

Wild Things,"In Where the Wild Things Are, Spike Jonze’s masterful translation of Maurice Sendak’s beloved book, the pains, and uncertainties of growing up find a deeply personal home.",914
Wild Things,"It’s as honest a tale of being a child as you’ll find on screen, with all of the fantasy and reality and joy and anxiety of childhood grounded in the imagery and the landscapes of a tyke’s mind.",914
Wild Things,"There's plenty of amazing, surreal imagery and a brooding atmosphere, but little magic brightens this fantasy world.",914
Wild Things,"Where the Wild Things Are isn't designed to distract children, but rather to celebrate them.",914
Wild Things,"A moving, thoughtful look back at a time in our lives when we didn't understand the way the world works.",914

Wild Things,"Here's a film that manages to stay true to its roots, while expanding it into new depths that will surely please all the book's fans.",914
Wild Things,It's a brilliant film in how it gives our character an opportunity to confront himself and his mother and realize they are both imperfect but trying.,914
Wild Things,This isn't just an adaptation of a beloved children's book-it's a reworking of the story that captures the essence of the thing and blows it out in a way that's both unexpected and familiar.,914
Wild Things,"The emotional departure Max finally takes from the Wild Things almost redeems the rest of the film in its wordless anguish. Yet, for all that, it still doesn't have the charm of the brief original.",914
Primary Colors,"By playing the political satire straight, Newell and screenwriter Elaine May drained Primary Colors of all its potential vibrancy, leaving only a bland dramedy in its place.",915
Primary Colors,"The film makes a good pseudo-documentary and presents several ideas that should be considered when looking at the presidency of the man everyone feels cheats on his wife, but can still effectively run the country.",915
Primary Colors,"Primary Colors has some wonderful comic moments, but it doesn't enlighten us much about the political process.",915
Primary Colors,"Primary Colors, Nichols' second feature with screenwriter and former stand-up comedy partner Elaine May, is mainstream filmmaking at its most accomplished.",915
Primary Colors,"The performances are splendid, beginning with Travolta's magnificent turn as the big-hearted but hardballing man with 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. on his horizon.",915
Primary Colors,"If you take away the eerie similarities to the Clinton campaign,Primary Colors serves as a fine satire in its own right.",915
Primary Colors,Primary Colors perfectly captures the spirit of its topic and time to become The Big Chill of politics.,915
Primary Colors,Well-acted drama full of Clinton-era jabs.,915
Primary Colors,A savvy and thought-provoking look at the nature of contemporary American politics.,915
Primary Colors,"Travolta is amazingly Clintonesque as Stanton, a role that I never believed he could pull off.",915
Lost in Space,"The film easily plays on its title, because the acting, plot and many other aspects are truly “Lost in Space.”",916
Lost in Space,A galactic slump of a movie that stuffs its travel bag with special effects but forgets to pack the charm.,916
Lost in Space,"After seeing Lost in Space, my first impulse was to say that it had been made by a bunch of sorcerers' apprentices who didn't know how to tell a story with their high-tech tools. But why give apprenticeship a bad name?",916
Lost in Space,"The new robot is a disappointment. Instead of the endearingly low-tech fireplug of yore that warned Will Robinson of encroaching danger, the new machine is all bells and whistles and no fun at all. Kinda like the movie itself.",916
Lost in Space,"Much of the movie plays like a live-action video game, and the sequel-ready ending feels akin to falling off a cliff. But with its appealing mix of heart and adventure, Lost in Space is great fun for children of the '60s or the '90s.",916
Lost in Space,"Time-travel cliches... dialogue that's neither self-mocking nor serious, and an ostentatious though not particularly exciting production design keep the movie from taking off.",916
Lost in Space,Once again an idea for a big budgeted feature film has been pulled from old issues of TV Guide.,916
Lost in Space,"Lost in Space glides along smoothly on special effects and punchy editing. At about the one-hour mark, however, the movie abandons itself to the noise, chaos and empty spectacle of the new-style Hollywood blockbuster, where story ceases to matter.",916
Lost in Space,"If all you want is special effects, you may have come to the right galaxy. But if you're looking for old-fashioned goofiness, you'll be shouting, ""Beam me up, Scotty!'' Or whatever the Lost in Space equivalent of that is.",916
Lost in Space,"The overreachers who made this super-scale mess failed to realize one essential truth about great science-fiction cinema: Sometimes the low road is the best road, even in outer space.",916
Mercury Rising,Offers the viewer a pleasant surprise. [Full review in Spanish],917
Mercury Rising,I must admit I was underwhelmed by Mercury Rising - in fact the temperature actually sank.,917
Mercury Rising,There's such a lack of vision behind Mercury Rising that the title could have it going in either direction and it would still end up in the same familiar place.,917
Mercury Rising,The actors' serious faces are out of place in this hopelessly silly action conspiracy.,917

Mercury Rising,"Baldwin's Kudrow is a one-dimensional, humorless variation on his corporate tyrant in Glengarry Glen Ross.",917
Mercury Rising,"Fortunately, as directed with muscle and heart by Harold Becker, this tale of an angry die-hard and an orphaned autistic boy caught in a deadly government plot ranks at least as high as John McTiernan's first collaboration with an embattled Willis.",917
Mercury Rising,Standard action fare with a false overlay of social conscience.,917
Mercury Rising,The real treat is seeing Big Daddy Bruce playing the papa bear part to the little lost boy.,917
Mercury Rising,An anaemic time-waster you've seen before that fails to create tension or generate the suspense this genre cries out for.,917
City of Angels,"Its concept of the fallen angel seems grounded to me by that illuminating presence of Nicolas Cage, but it lacks a few lights to reach heaven. [Full review in Spanish]",918
City of Angels,"Everything the over-the-top Ghost should have been - stylish, endearing and, watching it now 23 years on, enduring - City of Angels' only disappointment is that it didn't make even more of the Cannes-winning source material.",918
City of Angels,"City of Angels is an exercise in rapt, soapy quietude — a hymn to sappiness.",918
City of Angels,Glossy romance as an angel falls for a surgeon.,918
City of Angels,"The movie's eerie, slightly menacing vision of black-clad angels lurking in the shadowy corners of unsuspecting lives is genuinely haunting.",918
City of Angels,A good deal better than it has any right to be.,918
City of Angels,"Strains to achieve the enchantingly sublime, but ends up sinking to the depressingly ridiculous.",918
City of Angels,"As a remake it's not as poetic as Wenders' masterpiece Wings of Desire, but it's supremely mounted (by ace lenser John Seale) and contains touching performances from Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan deviating from their respective screen images.",918
City of Angels,"Funnier than Wenders' version, and it also succeeds in visualising LA as a magical city while dealing intelligently with the themes of mortality, sacrifice, free will, and the mixed blessings of the human condition.",918
City of Angels,An emotionally uninvolving flick that attempts to play on the heart strings of the viewer and fails in its effort.,918
"City of Lost Children, The",An extraordinary and twisted fairytale...,919
"City of Lost Children, The","Best described as a hybrid of Terry Gilliam and the Coens, with dashes of Jules Verne, Charles Dickens, and Rube Goldberg added to the mix.",919
"City of Lost Children, The","A marvel manufactured with handmade, painstaking craft rather than manufactured wonder. A champion for continued imagination that demonstrates the comparative power of parable over preachy sermon. An unsullied vision of gothic heft & pictographic purity.",919

"City of Lost Children, The",It feels like concept art come to life.,919
"City of Lost Children, The","City of Lost Children is unmistakably of its era: filled with oddball artifacts, and itself quite pointedly an oddball artifact, seeking approval on those very terms.",919
"City of Lost Children, The",Jeunet and Caro have distinctive signatures like nobody else's.,919
"City of Lost Children, The","On visual terms alone, The City of Lost Children is something of a masterpiece, using state-of-the-art physical, optical and digital special effects to stretch cinematic boundaries.",919

Farewell My Concubine,"What Farewell My Concubine is, most clearly, immediately, and strikingly, is staggeringly beautiful.",921
Farewell My Concubine,"A tale in which gender roles and sexuality clash in a world built on tradition and artifice, becoming intertwined with the ever-shifting march of time that leaves little time for personal truth.",921
Farewell My Concubine,"Chen Kaige offers a definitive vision of what it looks, sounds, and feels like to realize that the personal is always political.",921
Farewell My Concubine,It remains a bravura act of filmmaking. ... The restoration of Farewell My Concubine for this release is among the finest I've seen in the Criterion Collection.,921

Farewell My Concubine,"The movie is more stunning than ever, a daring blend of history and personal storytelling with one of the most striking performances of its era from Leslie Cheung.",921
Dead Man,"In the second film. calculated commercial interests, which are generally guaranteed to kill off genuine audience enthusiasm, have won out.",922
Dead Man,"Although the previous film ended rather resolutely, there's no denying that the further tales of Jack Sparrow are significantly suitable affairs for cinematic realization.",922

Dead Man,"The rollicking adventure, beautifully designed and filled with impressive visual effects, is a boatload of fun.",922
Dead Man,A messy film can be just as boring as one where nothing happens and that is the case here.,922
Dead Man,"The result is an overproduced movie that tries so strenuously hard to be ""fun"" that it's a chore to sit through. For all its razzle-dazzle production values, the story itself feels cluttered, hard to follow and hard to care about",922
Raise the Red Lantern,"Once again making exceptional use of bright colour, symbolic compositions, stylised sets and the breathtaking rural landscape, director Zhang Yimou has fashioned a compelling and at times erotic story about the repression of women in 1920s China.",923
Raise the Red Lantern,"Zhang seems to suggest, the price for rebellion and transgression is still death or madness.",923
Raise the Red Lantern,"In Raise the Red Lantern, Zhang Yimou's most widely acclaimed film, the Chinese director portrays life as a series of performative gestures under the duress of cultural tradition, prescribed gender roles, and hierarchical power structures.",923
Raise the Red Lantern,"The feminist anthem here is a subtle wisp bolstered by sumptuousness, Zhang's masterful composition and Gong.",923
Raise the Red Lantern,This incomparably handsome film quickens and darkens into a fascinating drama of sexual politics in a time when women were little more than pampered prisoners.,923
Raise the Red Lantern,"With its beautiful look and haunting themes and sublime performances, Raise The Red Lantern is Yimou's master work.",923
Raise the Red Lantern,"Visually ravishing and emotionally cold, Zhang's third feature is one long series of pushes and pulls.",923
Raise the Red Lantern,"One of Yimou's two or three masterpieces, this visually stunning film offers an extraordinary view of gender, sexuality, female rivalry and bonding in a historical context (1920s China) that bears some political relevance to the present time.",923
Raise the Red Lantern,"A haunting, contemplative study of man's inhumanity to man (or, in this case, woman's inhumanity to woman), as well as the restrictions and feudal intricacies of Chinese society.",923
Raise the Red Lantern,"Funcionando tanto como drama quanto como alegoria, o filme desenvolve seu tema com uma fotografia não apenas belíssima, mas também simbólica.",923
White Squall,"Once you get through all the cliches of the calm waters, there is a 20-minute movie somewhere within the two-hour running time.",924
White Squall,"Bridges does his best to command the emotional resonance we assume motivated Sheldon, but scant characterization marks him merely as a cipher for brawny, brain-washed ideations of what masculinity's supposed to look like.",924
White Squall,"Though lavishly produced and based on a true story, it still fails to satisfy.",924
White Squall,"The filmmakers take a rather facile, anachronistic ""Oprah""-esque approach toward the boys' feelings about their families and the Skipper's role as a ""tough love""-minded surrogate father.",924
White Squall,"This particular landlubber felt like jelly for the rest of the day, notwithstanding the hokey courtroom showdown that closes the picture.",924
White Squall,"An old-fashioned, white-knuckle adventure with the excellent Bridges adding another great characterization to his increasingly impressive resume.",924
White Squall,Bridges puts his shoulder to the wheel and impresses audiences.,924
White Squall,An Excellent Picture. It doesn't get any better,924
White Squall,Stunning ocean visuals and a gut-wrenching storm sequence. An underrated and very good coming of age story.,924
White Squall,"Despite great scenery, the distinctive visual ideas of Mr. Scott (Alien, Blade Runner) and the strong dramatic presence of Mr. Bridges, most of White Squall remains listless and tame.",924
Down Periscope,"...a sluggish comedy that slowly-but-surely squanders its raft of appealing, seemingly foolproof elements...",926
Down Periscope,"Far from feminist, though I enjoyed seeing so many men doing the cleaning. There are fun moments and Kelsey Grammer as the hapless new sub captain is rather good if not hapless enough. Bruce Dern and Rip Torn spar enjoyably, but it lacks actual jokes.",926
Down Periscope,"Some innuendo, profanity in mediocre slapstick comedy.",926
Down Periscope,"It's not exactly a bad movie, but it's so forgettable that it's almost exhausting.",926

"Flower of My Secret, The","Almodóvar still has his fun in The Flower of My Secret, but he is no longer just a child thumbing his nose at the world.",927
"Flower of My Secret, The","Though unlikely to gain the blessing of the Pope, the conversion of Pedro Almodóvar from romper-room decadence to something akin to adult drama may strike many as little short of miraculous.",927
"Flower of My Secret, The","Not since Fassbinder has a director so mastered the trick of using ""corny"" dialogue at once to heighten and to ironise everyday tragedy.",927
"Flower of My Secret, The","The Flower of My Secret is beautifully filmed and strikingly designed, but, more important, it is Almodovar's first attempt at a drama in the Tennessee Williams mode... it still shows a popular filmmaker challenging his audience and himself to dig deeper.",927
"Flower of My Secret, The","There is not much of a plot; just real, romantically entwined lives -- a world away from the gaudy camp Almodovar had begun to tire us with.",927
"Flower of My Secret, The","If it isn't as successful as his very best work, neither is it a failure -- and there are certainly enough Alomodovarisms to bring a smile to anyone's face",927
"Flower of My Secret, The",Dramatizes the contentious relationship between fiction and reality.,927
"Flower of My Secret, The",an archetypal romantic comedy that reshapes the mold,927
"Flower of My Secret, The","I found this dramatization a mature Almodovar work, perceptive and cutting through in an incisive way to the everyday problems in life that wear people down.",927
"Flower of My Secret, The","Though The Flower of My Secret is a slight work, it is a pleasing return to form.",927
Harriet the Spy,Fans of the book will want to see this film.,929
Harriet the Spy,"A below mediocre adaptation of the popular novel that is nonetheless served well by the two female leads, but all representative of the adults world (parents, teachers, psychologists) are narrow, standard-issue constructions.",929
Harriet the Spy,A kids' movie that's more serious - and substantial - than most.,929
Harriet the Spy,"Will remind parents of their own youth, and it will aid those living theirs out now to cope a little easier -- and that's just what a children's film should do.",929
Harriet the Spy,A better-than-expected kid's-book adaptation.,929
Harriet the Spy,The whimsical and meaningless first part dissolves into a mean spirited and disturbing concluding section.,929
Harriet the Spy,"Like the novel, Harriet the Spy is a rare children's story that celebrates the budding artistic spirit.",929
Harriet the Spy,A very draggy affair because Harriet's exploits are treated like an episodic laundry list.,929
Harriet the Spy,"As the film progresses, the story becomes engaging.",929
Harriet the Spy,"Fresh and charming, it never plays down to kids.",929
Chain Reaction,At least the overarching theme of humankind's contributions to planetary annihilation grows increasingly more relevant throughout the years.,930
Chain Reaction,An enjoyably mindless action adventure flick welded to a ludicrously cumbersome storyline.,930
Chain Reaction,...the movie often feels like an attempt by filmmaker Andrew Davis to replicate the massive (and entirely justified) success of 1993's The Fugitive.,930
Chain Reaction,"A pretty typical take on the ""wrongly-accused"" genre.",930
Chain Reaction,As dull and run-of-the-mill as they come.,930
Chain Reaction,Watchable but forgettable Fugitive-clone. Keanu as rocket scientist - more power to him.,930

Chain Reaction,Just one of the many Keanu speed bumps found in your local video store.,930
Chain Reaction,The chain reaction among audiences will likely be a contagious snore.,930
Chain Reaction,Just one more summer explosion.,930
"Island of Dr. Moreau, The","Not even the most devoted Frankenheimer enthusiast will find a coherent outcome, no matter how layered it may be with admirable degrees of pure oddity and (arguably intentional) hokum.",931
"Island of Dr. Moreau, The","John Frankenheimer is credited as director, but given the scrambled, multiple agendas at play here, he seems to function more like a bemused traffic cop.",931
"Island of Dr. Moreau, The","Thanks to special creature and makeup effects by Stan Winston, the various deformed fiends take center stage, showcasing diverting designs and a decent production value.",931
"Island of Dr. Moreau, The","Brando's performance is enormous fun, but it's not just a joke. He's hilarious and gently mesmerizing at once, and director John Frankenheimer savvily adjusts the tone of his movie to fit Brando's daft brilliance.",931
"Island of Dr. Moreau, The",Roughly akin to watching a slow-motion train wreck in which the flames spread into the brush and become an out-of-control wildfire. What the hell happened?,931
"Island of Dr. Moreau, The","It's not to say there's not a lot wrong with the film, but rather to suggest that the chief criticisms of it being strange and ""a mess"" aren't among them.",931
"Island of Dr. Moreau, The",Muddled effort.,931
"Island of Dr. Moreau, The","An often fascinating mess, but a mess all the same.",931
"Island of Dr. Moreau, The",There's the obese Brando pretending to be God while dressed in gauzy white robes like a demented pope,931
"Island of Dr. Moreau, The","Amazingly, Kilmer delivers an odder performance than Brando. Creepy retelling.",931
First Kid,"Technically, this thing is just all over the place, and it's hard for me to overlook it...",932
First Kid,"Fine, a little long despite only being 104 minutes...the chemistry did kick in around the second half, but it's just an implausible, crazy movie...",932
First Kid,Goofy '90s comedy with pratfalls and some gunplay.,932
First Kid,Unfunny Disney comedy. Sinbad needs a better vehicle.,932
First Kid,Utterly conventional.,932
First Kid,The film sags around mid-point and never completely recovers.,932
"Funeral, The","... Within its hopeless realism, there's a moving romantic fantasy.",933
"Funeral, The","He doesn't break any new ground, but The Funeral wraps its tendrils around you all the same. It burrows under your skin.",933
"Funeral, The","This Turkish horror has plenty working for it. Writer and director Ocrun Behram captures isolation, anguish and horrors perfectly.",933
"Funeral, The","Despite losing slight momentum in the second act, the film is flecked with humorously quirky moments...",933
"Preacher's Wife, The","That’s the case with The Preacher’s Wife, a film that takes the classic black-and-white film The Bishop’s Wife and turns it into a glossier, minimally inspiring film.",934
"Preacher's Wife, The",Incredible music and Denzel and Whitney have fantastic chemistry,934
"Preacher's Wife, The","While the movie has heartwarming stamped all over it, the plot stacks the deck against this light comedy with a dark undercurrent of marital insecurity, failure of leadership and testing one's faith.",934
"Preacher's Wife, The","One flash of Washington's warm, genuine smile is enough to hook anyone. There is a sincerity, a gentleness and a kindness that comes across no matter what role he plays and this one lets those qualities shine.",934
"Preacher's Wife, The","Has a big heart, but no sense of pace and conflict to sustain the viewing experience for an unnerving two hours.",934
"Preacher's Wife, The","While the sheer force of Washington's charisma keeps his otherwise monotonous character watchable, the same can't be said for the late Houston, woefully flat in a malnourished role.",934
"Preacher's Wife, The","The music, the chemistry between Houston and Washington, and minor characters that make us smile make this film worth watching-especially around Christmas, when this is set.",934
"Preacher's Wife, The",Denzel's Christmas angel meets Whitney's voice.,934
"Preacher's Wife, The","Houston's inevitable chart-toppers aside, the film mainly sells the values of cooperation and good-samaritanism.",934
"Preacher's Wife, The",Definitely not Denzel Washington's finest hour.,934

Paradise Road,Never lifts off to anywhere that's profound or moving or interesting,935

Brassed Off,Brassed Off' should not be missed.,936
Brassed Off,"You'll definitely laugh, you'll probably cry, and you might even want to take up the flugelhorn.",936
Brassed Off,The movie delivers way too much doom-and-gloom-pah-pah.,936
Brassed Off,"The edgy pace writer/director Mark Herman brings to the drama and his presentation of the musical sequences can't be faulted, and he draws remarkable performances from a cast that includes Ewan McGregor and Pete Postlethwaite.",936
Brassed Off,"Pete Postlethwaite is moving as the bandleader, whose dream of taking his players to compete at the Albert Hall nearly eclipses his appreciation of the dire issues they face.",936
Brassed Off,"[An] audacious, angry but oddly agreeable screed on the social evils of Thatcherism in 1992 Great Britain.",936
Brassed Off,"The film is sentimental and its politics black-and-white. Still, ""Brassed Off"" is as rousing and immensely likable as a superb brass band, which the film is ostensibly about.",936
Brassed Off,"""Brassed Off"" is about as sloppy as it gets, but for nearly two-thirds of the movie the gushiness is pretty much kept in check. And those two thirds are quite a treat.",936
Brassed Off,"It survives through its never-failing sense of humour and the fact that by its loving depiction of alternative values -- of warmth and community -- to the ones it assaults, you feel it has earned the right to turn attacker.",936
Brassed Off,"Herman has come up with a neat idea in a setting he knows and understands, and the script, helped along by an excellent selection of Brit character actors, has a generally taught, well-worked-over feel.",936
"Thousand Acres, A","Despite the golden promise of the cornfields, its crops are barren.",937
"Thousand Acres, A","Both beg the question of whether rage or forgiveness is the correct moral response to immoral acts. It's a good question, but one that's probably better contemplated by reading a good book rather than watching a pale imitation.",937
"Thousand Acres, A","With, in effect, two authors to accommodate, the movie exhausts the audience by piling on the tear-jerky plot: fatal diseases and accidents, extramarital affairs, lawsuits, you name it.",937
"Thousand Acres, A","This is the type of perverse material which would have made a fine high-profile spectacle from the late 1950s or 60s, when its issues could ride the line between sacred and profane, obvious and subtle.",937
"Thousand Acres, A",A Thousand Acres plays like five masochistic Lifetime-channel movies that have been mashed together until they have all the flavor of strained peas.,937
"Thousand Acres, A","From the first frame, a silhouetted barn and windmill at dawn, the images feel prefab, and the all-purpose wistful tinkly piano and sighing strings pin them even more boringly down.",937
"Thousand Acres, A","Cry, cry, cry. Hug, hug, hug. Yadda, yadda, yadda.",937
"Thousand Acres, A","All the characters are sharply defined, with Lange and Pfeiffer in fine form, and Robards suitably sour as the grumpy old curmudgeon, but the plot has been watered down until it is little more than a Waltons-styled soap.",937
"Thousand Acres, A","Proof that Hollywood no longer knows how to make that former staple, the women's picture.",937
"Thousand Acres, A","Owing more to the spirit of Oprah than to the Bard, pic serves up an earnest but unconvincing stew of received notions about family dysfunction, awkwardly put across by a script wheezing with melodramatic contrivances.",937
"Smile Like Yours, A",It's the cinematic equivalent of having a saccharine-coated tongue depressor jammed down your throat.,938
"Smile Like Yours, A","Keith Sample's film aspires to the innocent charm of a newlywed comedy like Barefoot in the Park, but gets bogged down in witless sex jokes.",938
"Smile Like Yours, A",The adorable Kinnear is not doing himself any favors with overblown sit-coms like this.,938
"Smile Like Yours, A","A Smile Like Yours makes no one smile or cry, just wince. The script is unwieldy, and Kinnear and Holly stuggle in every frame to make characters likable.",938
"Smile Like Yours, A","After a while, I could smell the jokes coming like Grandma's two-day-old stuffed cabbage.",938
"Smile Like Yours, A","This may not be the worst romantic comedy of the year, but surely it's the flattest. The thing has no energy. It just lies there, waiting to be kicked.",938
"Smile Like Yours, A","On paper, infertility would seem a distasteful subject matter for light comedy. On screen, it only gets worse.",938
"Smile Like Yours, A",Kooky Joan Cusack can't provide sufficient comic relief in this incredibly naive attempt at schmaltz.,938
"Smile Like Yours, A","It's as compelling as a car commercial, as deep as a diaper pail.",938
"Smile Like Yours, A",The brief Lucy scene was funnier than anything else in the movie. If only the clip had lasted longer.,938

Murder in the First,"Playing the hero of an issues movie (and this one is dripping with issues) is usually a thankless task, but Slater carries this one with ease.",939
Airheads,"A critical and commercial flop, this rock 'n' roll comedy nonetheless features a cast of comedic talent who between them have enough screen presence and comic timing to carry its so-so screenplay.",940
Airheads,Any movie where David Arquette is just hanging out in the background for a majority of the runtime is good in my book.,940
Airheads,"Airheads benefits substantially from its myriad of appealing, entertaining performances...",940
Airheads,A dumb comedy.,940
Airheads,"Everyone in the film has simply been better and funnier, before. Even Fraser.",940

With Honors,"Obviously inspired by the success of Scent of a Woman, this one could have been called Scent of a Bum.",941
With Honors,"Do you amuse me, Joe Pesci? No, you do not.",941

With Honors,One of the few films I've ever walked out on. Pesci and Fraser serve up unsympathetic and grating characters.,941

What's Love Got to Do with It,The cast is also great with James having lovely chemistry with costar Shazad Latif and Emma Thompson grounding the entire production as James’ mother. If you like this genre I bet this one will be a winner!,942

"Affair to Remember, An","'Weepies' may not be high art, but for those who love them, An Affair to Remember is the Mona Lisa.",966
"Affair to Remember, An",surprisingly tedious,966
"Affair to Remember, An","Often regarded (or dreaded) as the ultimate chick flick, due in no small amount to its fetish-object role in Sleepless in Seattle, An Affair to Remember deserves better than to be the receptor of Meg Ryan's crocodile tears.",966

Eye for an Eye,John Schlesinger is one of the finest directors of our movie past. It is sad that this is all he apparently can find to direct.,974
Eye for an Eye,"If Eye for an Eye were just another dumb thriller about killing a bad guy, it would not be so irritating. But by raising the moral issue, it is more like a dumb TV movie proposing a vigilantelite brand of violent retribution.",974
Eye for an Eye,With a cynical eye for the bottom line.,974
Eye for an Eye,"Although it poses the interesting moral dilemma behind taking the law into your own hands, Schlesinger's film borders on the distasteful in its portrayal of rape and murder.",974
Eye for an Eye,Any pretence of thoughtful debate has long since been abandoned.,974
Eye for an Eye,Directed by John Schlesinger from a screenplay by the Posse Comitatus.,974
Eye for an Eye,"[A] really awful, hysterical thriller.",974
Eye for an Eye,This blatant button-pusher plays upon our most primal emotions as well as the increasing disdain for the criminal justice system.,974
Eye for an Eye,A B movie that somehow won the lottery and got an A-movie cast and director.,974
Fear,"A grindingly cynical study of human nature, with each participant willing to sacrifice the others for a bigger payoff.",975
Fear,"…this venerable, classic, timeless movie has been artfully revived (via 2024 UHD) n a way that should have you vibrating all the way to South America and back, over 500km of bad road…",975
Fear,"Cluzot’s treatment of the finale (I sighed in relief at his staying with the juggernaut irony of the book) is a tour de force. The actors are inordinately real, especially Charles Vanel.",975
Fear,"Clouzot’s stark, simple imagery and painstaking attention to detail creates a riveting tension that never lets up.... It’s a white knuckler of the top rank.",975
Fear,"Henri-Georges Clouzot was the only man that Alfred Hitchcock considered a serious rival in terms of suspense in filmmaking, and The Wages of Fear is a resounding blow in the French master’s favor.",975
Fear,"Nitroglycerin figures prominently in the plot of Henri-Georges Clouzot’s The Wages of Fear, but it’s the movie itself that’s truly explosive, a powder keg of social outrage and cinematic thrills.",975
Fear,"Clouzot makes the most of the suspense inherent in such a tale, you can be sure, but his attitude is hopeless from the start and a sense of doom hangs over the film from the very beginning, long before the terrible end.",975
Fear,The brutal narrative cynicism and political commentary in The Wages of Fear indicate the unflinching nature of its maker.,975
Fear,...the greatest thriller to ever turn a moviegoer's knuckles white.,975
Fear,"The Wages of Fear will keep you tipped forward on the edge of your seat, your palms sweaty and your heart thumping wildly.",975
Solo,"... rough, whether you’re returning to the series from earlier in the year or just wanting to discover something new to binge-watch.",976
Solo,"Exhausting, shallow, overlong and tedious.",976
Solo,Solo Leveling – ReAwakening delivers all that one can ask for from this style of project.,976
Solo,... reminds fans hungry for more why the series is as much fun as it is and hints at greater mysteries and violence to come.,976
Solo,"Too familiar for ""Solo Leveling"" fans, and too inscrutable for newcomers, the latest film in the recap trend struggles to identify its audience.",976
"Substitute, The",...an appealingly larger-than-life premise that's employed to watchable yet consistently (and disappointingly) hit-and-miss effect...,977
"Substitute, The",This movie was a mess. Tom Berenger was atrocious.,977
"Substitute, The",This was really bad. It was over the top and completely insane.,977
"Substitute, The","Many of Berenger's tough-guy routines are affectively cinematic, but the pacing is off enough that the action becomes noticeably sparse and the tension alleviated too often.",977
"Substitute, The","Worth the time for its occasional nuggets of interesting action, and the performance by Berenger.",977
"Substitute, The",What begins as watchable quickly degenerates into a no-brain action flick that produces a ton of derisive laughter.,977
"Substitute, The","Really fun movie. Twist on the ""Dangerous Minds"" scenario.",977
"Substitute, The",Mediocre action flick with an ex-marine teacher taking his gang-banging students to task. Don't bother.,977
"Substitute, The",There's a sense of shrewd observation throughout The Substitute that makes it come alive and seem quite a few cuts above such usual genre fare.,977
"Substitute, The","An angry, white, mercenary movie out to spill blood and beat its manly chest.",977
Heaven's Prisoners,Baldwin needs to fire his manager,978
Heaven's Prisoners,"Baldwin is shockingly uninteresting, walking through this role... or should I say sweating, for Dave is covered in perspiration in practically every scene.",978
Heaven's Prisoners,A humid and sweaty potboiler that fritters away the potential to be hot and steamy.,978
Heaven's Prisoners,[A] bayou slog.,978
Heaven's Prisoners,"Heaven's Prisoners [is] such an overwrought and high-strung example of melodramatic excess that they should have scheduled rest breaks for the actors. The movie has plot enough for three films, although still not quite enough to make sense of this one.",978
Heaven's Prisoners,Script is so bad that you want to laugh at it rather than with it.,978

Mother Night,"A fine, melancholy adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut’s 1961 novel, with Nick Nolte in peak, vulnerable form.",980
Mother Night,Frankie Faison comes the closest to Vonnegut's spirit in his bold caricature of the Black Fuehrer of Harlem.,980

Dangerous Ground,"By the time it reaches the run-down of an adolescent murderer over half the snow-covered hills of northern California, the customer is as fed up with motion as the panting actors.",981
Dangerous Ground,"It's a film that defies not just genre expectation, but even the expectations it sets up for itself, culminating in a devastating ending where the only comfort left is the possibility of some human connection.",981
Dangerous Ground,There is a certain kind of beauty that expresses so much in such a short space that no words can capture its essence. All I know is that it stirred the deepest reaches of my soul.,981
Dangerous Ground,"Considering the talents of all involved, it ought to be a masterpiece; but genre takes its revenge, and the picture's rhythm never recovers from the unanticipated quiescence of the rural milieu.",981
Dangerous Ground,"Is there a film noir that spends so much time watching the landscape change from the driver's seat of a moving car, and then find the same fury and intolerance is here in the heartland too?",981
Dangerous Ground,"The performances are potent, the direction by Nicholas Ray is suitably moody, and the score by Bernard Herrmann is terrific.",981
Dangerous Ground,"An exalted modulation from harsh to lyrical and back, the culmination of Nicholas Ray's Borzagean side",981
Dangerous Ground,"Haunting mix of police story, romance and tale of regeneration.",981
Dangerous Ground,"What succeeds in On Dangerous Ground is the raw emotionalism that bleeds out from the screen, unmatched in any of Ray's other films.",981
Dangerous Ground,Nicholas Ray's classic noir starring Ryan and Lupino.,981
Maximum Risk,...a briskly-paced thriller that benefits from its compelling storyline and smattering of exciting action sequences...,982
Maximum Risk,"As usual, the cars crash into easy targets, like cardboard boxes or outdoor furniture. Glass crashes easily, and most of Van Damme's stunts are executed by stunt doubles.",982
Maximum Risk,"There is always a place for this kind of unpretentious, functional action cinema.",982
Maximum Risk,"Director Ringo Lam proves that exciting action sequences go a long way in tying together a cinematic adventure, even if the plot is more or less irrelevant.",982
Maximum Risk,"There's plenty of spectacle in Maximum Risk ... There's also a lot of nonsense, a convoluted plot and very little in the way of intrigue.",982
Maximum Risk,"Gets in as many car chases, martial arts fights and explosions as it can while it eschews emotion.",982
Maximum Risk,"The plot holds together pretty well, which is not always the case in Van Damme's movies, and does not require the concoction of labored explanations for his pronounced accent.",982
Maximum Risk,"...the movie has some good moments of intrigue and adventure, and with a more charismatic hero it might have worked better.",982
Maximum Risk,The energetic action isn't quite enough to overcome an undernourished story. [Blu-Ray],982
Maximum Risk,It's a visceral delight that refuses to be deterred by niceties of plot or character consistency and prefers sweat to emotion.,982
"Rich Man's Wife, The",Filmmaker Jones delivers a slow-moving thriller that's generally watchable enough (if entirely forgettable)...,983
"Rich Man's Wife, The","'Who is Keyser Sze?' Hard to believe, but the signature line from The Usual Suspects has everything to do with this limp 'from-hell' thriller.",983
"Rich Man's Wife, The","The Rich Man's Wife is not a great movie, but it's competent and effective enough, and I might have been tempted to give it a recommendation if I hadn't felt so cheated at the end.",983
Shadow Conspiracy,...a somewhat sluggish thriller that never becomes quite as engrossing or enthralling as one might’ve hoped...,984
Shadow Conspiracy,...what's truly surprising is that this terrific cast was assembled to deliver such a crazy message...,984
Shadow Conspiracy,"Corpses pile up, dreadful secrets are uncovered, and Bishop eventually gets to the bottom of things, a full hour after the least attentive viewer will have figured out who's behind it all.",984
Shadow Conspiracy,"Bland, interminable chase scenes take up so much of the story -- the hackneyed plot doesn't need much exposition -- that the sheer repetitiveness begins to amaze you.",984
Shadow Conspiracy,"Sadly, Sheen doesn't even look profound. Like a zombie who's spent too much time in the gym, he blunders heavily from one stunt to the next, his pursed lips conveying nothing more than pique.",984
Shadow Conspiracy,The climactic assassination attempt... is so ridiculous there's only one real danger: that the president (and the audience) will laugh to death.,984
Shadow Conspiracy,"The story's driven completely by coincidence and baffling lunacy, and you'll be driven... to press eject on your VCR.",984
Shadow Conspiracy,Ridiculous.,984
Shadow Conspiracy,The film is so contemptuous of its audience it doesn't even bother to present a surface resemblance to reality.,984
Shadow Conspiracy,The whole thing is so vague and preposterous and paranoid that it almost goes without saying that Donald Sutherland plays a key role.,984
Blood & Wine,"...the movie fares best in its briskly-paced, unpredictable opening stretch...",985
Blood & Wine,"An amusingly caustic, straight-up serving of film noir staples spiced with star charisma.",985
Blood & Wine,As lifeless as a flat wine.,985
Blood & Wine,"An engrossing thriller - and one sparkling with intelligence, with the surprising twists grounded in credible human behaviour.",985
Blood & Wine,"More blood than wine spills in this solid neo-noir romp. Chewy, juicy, and profound. Crack a bottle of vino and enjoy this fantastic movie.",985
Blood & Wine,A noir thriller about greed.,985
Blood & Wine,Rafelson shows that he can't handle noir themes as easily as the real masters of the genre.,985
Blood & Wine,"When Bob Rafelson decides to get nasty, he really means it.",985
Blood & Wine,"Bob Rafelson sends this movie out like a hissing flare from the island of the nearly-forgotten, and if justice had prevailed, moviegoers would have answered the call.",985
Blood & Wine,"The director benefits from a powerhouse duo in Nicholson and Caine. It's like watching two cats fight for the same mouse, because both characters are corrupted to the bone.",985
Turbulence,"It might not be quite as silly a premise as snakes on a plane, but a serial killer on a plane doesn’t sound like there’s much room to maneuver, either for the killer or the screenwriter.",986
Turbulence,"So, after a solid take-off, it's fair to say that Turbulence flubs both its in-flight entertainment and its landing.",986
Turbulence,...an agreeably larger-than-life premise that’s employed to initially middling (yet eventually compelling) effect by Butler...,986
Turbulence,"She’s better than Liotta, her character at least consistent and competent and up to the task of saving the day, but there’s an unfortunate flatness to her character throughout that gives Holly little room to play.",986
Turbulence,About the best thing that can be said about Turbulence is that you're unlikely to encounter it as an in-flight movie.,986
Turbulence,"Lame, lousy, horrid. No wonder Jim divorced Lauren.",986
Turbulence,"Fasten your seat belts, folks. It's going to be a cliche-cluttered ride.",986
Turbulence,"Turbulence thrashes about like a formula action picture that has stepped on a live wire: It's dead, but doesn't stop moving. It looks like it cost a lot of money, but none of that money went into quality.",986
Turbulence,"It might not be quite as silly a premise as snakes on a plane, but a serial killer on a plane doesn’t sound like there’s much room to maneuver, either for the killer or the screenwriter.",986
Turbulence,"So, after a solid take-off, it's fair to say that Turbulence flubs both its in-flight entertainment and its landing.",986
Underworld,"The production and costume designs were clearly labored over, but like any polished exterior that's merely a fragile casing for an empty center, the film waves off character development for skin-tight leather and pouty brooding.",987
Underworld,"One wishes that Kate Beckinsale got to have a little more fun as Selene and Kraven is a terrible villain, but the blue-filtered Matrix-rip off (action, costume, gun play) is very welcome. Plus: Nighy is having the absolute best time chewing the scenery.",987
Underworld,"Conspiracies and allegorical angles aside, this sleekly stylized monster mash ends up a big, muddy mess of bad guys: predator versus predator, and the winner takes the human race.",987
Underworld,A derivative and dramatically weak mess without so much as a design element that wasn't lifted from something better.,987
Underworld,"Pulpy, punk-ish story with some intense violence.",987
Underworld,...a hybrid horror and action film that succeeds as neither.,987
Underworld,Fails to deliver with anything truly tasty or memorable.,987
Underworld,...a relentlessly unpleasant fantasy epic...,987
Underworld,Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography perfectly captures the gothic comic-book feel.,987
Underworld,"[Underworld] could use more plot and deepened characters and less vapid expository dialogue, flashbacks and ballets of bullets.",987
"Beautician and the Beast, The","The awkward misunderstandings and crisscrossed romance has a goofy, so annoying it’s charming endearment that remains kitschy for fans of the cast.",988
"Beautician and the Beast, The","Drescher does her best, and she's very likable and charming, whatever her dramatic limitations. However, the script is complete garbage, the direction stinks, and Dalton is still a chin in search of a personality.",988
"Beautician and the Beast, The",Beauty and the Beast combined with Fran- what more could you ask for?,988
"Beautician and the Beast, The",A wildly uneven story.,988
"Beautician and the Beast, The","Dated '90s romcom has some stereotypes, innuendo.",988
"Beautician and the Beast, The","Cheesy, multi-accented culture-clash comedy that's seldom funny",988
"Beautician and the Beast, The","Manages to be sweet and likable, largely because Kwapis directs the actors well and treats the sub-Lubitsch material as if he actually believed in it.",988
"Beautician and the Beast, The","As hokey and banal as a sitcom, with predictable culture-clash gags and fairly flat one-liners.",988
"Beautician and the Beast, The",A charming surprise,988
"Beautician and the Beast, The",Standard feature-length sitcom material. For Drescher fans only.,988
Cats Don't Dance,The characters are dull in both form and content.,989
Cats Don't Dance,"I refuse to believe anything else but that a young Damien Chazelle walked into a movie theater, watched this and left thinking, “I’m going to make this movie, but it’ll be a 3-hour bacchanal with Brad Pitt.” (Mark Dindal kicked ass with this one)",989
Cats Don't Dance,We rarely get movies like this that have so much heart.,989
Cats Don't Dance,"Cats Don't Dance is a blast... There's a pleasing luminescence to the animation, with colors that glow like neon throughout.",989
Cats Don't Dance,"Cats Don't Dance has some of the sharp irreverence of the brilliant Who Framed Roger Rabbit. There are plenty of clever asides and witty one-liners, not to mention a few terrific supporting characters.",989
Cats Don't Dance,Very cute animation with Randy Newman music.,989
Cats Don't Dance,"Decked out with sharp and colorful design work, some well-drawn characters and six snappy Randy Newman tunes, this first entry from Turner Feature Animation goes down very easily but lacks a hook.",989
Cats Don't Dance,"While the animated characters, bright colors and an appealing Randy Newman score may keep the children content, Cats Don't Dance is no saccharine fantasy. Its Hollywood references and dark satire constitute its real strengths.",989
Cats Don't Dance,A happy-go-lucky romp that dishes up the most cartoon fun since Toy Story.,989
Cats Don't Dance,"For you fuddy duddies out there who think cartoons are for kids, I don't know when the last time you saw a cartoon was, but movie cartoons have never been for kids.",989
Anna Karenina,"While even skilled filmmakers would have trouble adapting Tolstoy’s novel in a straightforward form, Wright attempts a book-to-stage-to-film approach and, for the first time in his career, stretched his considerable talent thin.",990
Anna Karenina,"The machinery of the music box comes undone in our hands, but the light dancing on the little silver gears is still so beautiful and heartbreaking.",990
Anna Karenina,"The characters, so beautifully drawn by Tolstoy, are severely truncated in the film, functioning as relatively impoverished figures.",990
Anna Karenina,Anna Karenina is a boldly constructed and beautiful film.,990
Anna Karenina,"Enthralling, moving, exhilarating. Majestic and sweeping. The best and most brilliant interpretation of Tolstoy I have ever seen.",990
Anna Karenina,"One has to applaud Joe Wright's interpretation of 'Anna Karenina' which is a play on the Shakespeare adage, ""All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players""",990
Anna Karenina,"All of this calculated design, which plays like an astutely choreographed musical without any discernible music, only mutes our feelings for the roiling, raging passionate affair that's supposed to be transpiring before our eyes.",990
Anna Karenina,"A radiant Keira Knightley brings more depth to Tolstoy's heroine than you would ever expect. An ingenious adaptation, scripted by Tom Stoppard, frames lush visuals with a trompe l'oeil theatrical setting...",990
Anna Karenina,"Its nearly flawless craft is done at the expense of the story rather than in service of it, and that I think is its fatal mistake.",990
Anna Karenina,"Anna Karenina drags in the middle and rushes to its ugly end but the sets, the choreography, the glorious costumes and the secondary characters are pieces of a superior film.",990
Keys to Tulsa,This nonsensical picture appears to have been directed by a coma victim and edited by an axe maniac.,991
Keys to Tulsa,"The plot is full of italicised twists and kooky set-pieces, but grossly over-plotted and overwritten.",991
Keys to Tulsa,"This comedic crimer is a late-in-the-cycle Tarantino retread. Pyeton's script from Berkey's novel is deft, but Leslie Grief's awkward direction lacks modulation and visual style, and he doesn't even get decent performances from Stolz and Cameron Diaz.",991
Keys to Tulsa,"A messy mix of soap opera, film noir, black comedy, and social satire, none of which is done very well.",991
Keys to Tulsa,A ham-handed and just plain dumb modern Midwest noir.,991
Head Above Water,"Diaz is largely performing in a vacuum: Keitel, unbelievable for starters as a middle-aged judge, seems unsure at which pitch to play the largely physical comedy, and Sheffer, as the best friend, is fairly vanilla.",992
Head Above Water,"Diaz, clad mostly in a one-piece yellow swimsuit, is left floundering in the shallows of a script which relies on ludicrous human behaviour and mechanical plot twists, the latter signposted by an over-emphatic score.",992
Head Above Water,Debts must have been called in on this one.,992
Head Above Water,Interesting thriller with good twists.,992
Head Above Water,"One moment, ''Head Above Water'' plays like a clanking melodrama, the next like a gallows comedy of corrupt yuppie manners.",992
Head Above Water,"""intriguing, tricky and decidedly different""",992
Head Above Water,"After flailing around a lot, Head Above Water just about manages the title feat, though first-time director Jim Wilson is clearly out of his depth.",992
Head Above Water,"If you have to spend time with a corpse at the beach, this is better than ""Weekend at Bernie's."" But it's a near thing.",992
Hercules,"It’s not the most stand-out production from the studio, downgraded by some of the least impressive musical components, but it's nevertheless thoroughly entertaining.",993
Hercules,The film struggles to find a strong voice and identity as it drags itself through a rehashed story with weak characters that lack the iconic performances needed to elevate them.,993
Hercules,I guess it's something different from Disney which felt refreshing and it made me laugh.,993
Hercules,"Kids will love Hercules. It's fast-paced, it's funny, and it has a very positive message. Adults will enjoy it as well, thanks to its animated artistry and sly wit.",993
Hercules,One of [Disney's] more unique and outside the box animated adaptations.,993
Hercules,"'Hercules' may be second-tier Disney, but it's TOP second tier, not far behind the studio's best animated work.",993
Hercules,"[Blu-ray Review] Isn't one of the Mouse House's absolute best, but it is an astutely written entertainment with a keen aesthetic sense and a fun ensemble of characters. For Disney collectors, picking ""Hercules"" up is a no-brainer. Highly recommended.",993
Hercules,"...compiles pop-culture references and genre tropes that are not only crudely envisioned, but often downright contradictory to the story at hand.",993
Hercules,The most flat-out childish film of the Disney Renaissance: this is both its great triumph and ultimately the reason that it's so hard to care about it all that much.,993
Hercules,"[An] insipid, lifeless, animated feature.",993
"Last Time I Committed Suicide, The",Unbearably boring,994
"Kiss Me, Guido",The filmmaker runs afoul not with his primary-color strokes -- intransigence is the soul of good farce -- but rather with the lack of go-for-broke comic prowess that enables you to get away with them.,995
"Kiss Me, Guido","This minor indie farce plays gay and Italian-American stereotypical characters, resulting in a pleasant feel-good movie but no more.",995
"Kiss Me, Guido",Disappointing indie comedy. One joke that's not even that funny the first time.,995
"Kiss Me, Guido","Kiss Me, Guido is a movie with a lot of funny one-liners, but no place to go with them. Like a 30-minute sitcom, it acts like you already know all the characters and are just happy to have fresh dialogue.",995
"Big Green, The","Disney should be embarrassed, but since they own nearly every entertainment outlet known to man, who is to tell them?",996
"Big Green, The",Exactly what you'd expect from a kid's soccer flick: lots of balls being kicked.,996
"Big Green, The","In the right role, Olivia d'Abo would be irreplaceable. She has never found that role. Here, struggling gamely with the hopelessly predictable Big Green, she shows a quality that in another role, in another picture, could be luminous.",996
Stuart Saves His Family,"Wisely, ""Stuart Saves His Family"" attempts something tougher than the usual ""SNL"" movie, painting a fully fleshed-out portrait of seriocomic misery. In a subgenre littered with films worth forgetting, here is one that's good enough and smart enough.",997
Stuart Saves His Family,"It isn't good enough, it isn't smart enough, and, doggone it, most people won't like Stuart Saves His Family.",997
Stuart Saves His Family,"Often funny, darker than you'd expect, and firmly grounded in Franken's extensive experience of the 12-Step worldview.",997
Stuart Saves His Family,"Even if you find Franken hard to bear, as I do, the movie's take on how he functions in the world is both authoritative and compelling, and the movie steadily grows in stature.",997
Stuart Saves His Family,"Played unsuccessfully for laughs, it is ploddingly directed. And proudly proclaimed as a Ramis film. After this he should change his name or profession.",997
Stuart Saves His Family,"I prepared myself for yet another ""one joke"" Saturday Night Live movie here, but what I got was an enjoyable little film that actually touched upon some interesting issues...",997
Stuart Saves His Family,"Those familiar with Alcoholics Anonymous' 12-step recovery programme may bond in sympathy. The sentimentality, however, doesn't play.",997
Stuart Saves His Family,Not as bad as you'd expect,997
Stuart Saves His Family,"I forgive you, Al Franken. You were young and needed the money.",997
Stuart Saves His Family,"The plotting is surprisingly banal, involving even talk of a property easement and turning Stuart into the executor of a relative's estate. And the relatives' problems are taken semi-seriously, which is more than this lightweight film can handle.",997
Cabin Boy,"Most critics hated it, but it’s got “cult classic” written all over it.",998
Cabin Boy,"It's an aggressively bizarre movie, a mash-up of conflicting sensibilities that would only work for a niche audience.",998
Cabin Boy,"Weird comedy-fantasy cult classic with language, innuendo.",998
Cabin Boy,So...when is Get a Life coming out on DVD?,998
Cabin Boy,Strange little comedy that's a lot more intriguing than you might think.,998
Cabin Boy,A horrible movie with a classic line by David Letterman.,998
Cabin Boy,An aquired taste,998
Cabin Boy,"Extremely weird, and certainly not for everyone. Yet very, very brilliant in its own strange way.",998
Cabin Boy,"Most critics hated it, but it’s got “cult classic” written all over it.",998
Cabin Boy,"It's an aggressively bizarre movie, a mash-up of conflicting sensibilities that would only work for a niche audience.",998
Clean Slate,"Even in its transposition from Texas to colonial Africa in the 1930s, Tavernier’s work has the grace and delicacy of a movie made in its very own moment... a battle of blood and libido.",999
Clean Slate,"“Coup de Torchon” is one of the most devastatingly sly, raw and brilliant indictments of man’s inhumanity to  man as viewed through a colonial prism.",999
Clean Slate,"Shifting the locale of Jim Thompson's novel to Colonial Africa, Tavernier has made a compelling, well acted film.",999
Clean Slate,"This movie never quite breathes. It's an exercise. You can admire an exercise, but it's hard to really care about one.",999
Clean Slate,Clean Slate is a compelling offbeat morality play.,999
Clean Slate,It's often hilarious. It's just that that humor is so mordant that it's sometimes hard to accept.,999
Clean Slate,a study in amorality disguised as a sometimes shocking black comedy,999
Lightning Jack,"It isn't Paul Hogan's sad showing a writer/star of this feeble Western spoof about a gunfighter and his pupil that ought to worry us, it's the career of fine young actor Cuba Gooding Jr.",1000

Lightning Jack,"A good-natured, if laconic, oater that rides along nicely on the screen persona of writer/actor Paul Hogan.",1000
Lightning Jack,"The film has no internal comic rhythm to match its faltering sense of humor. Much of the time, it plods along like a mediocre conventional western.",1000
Lightning Jack,A Western for people that hate Westerns.,1000
Lightning Jack,Hogan should hang up his spurs until a truly original impulse comes along.,1000
Lightning Jack,"It's impossible to dislike Paul Hogan, and almost as hard to like his movies. They're as goodhearted as they are simple-minded.",1000
Lightning Jack,This road has been trod a few too many times before.,1000
"Stupids, The",It's so screamingly unfunny it verges on the surreal.,1001

"Pest, The",It pains me to admit just how obnoxious The Pest is because it has all the ingredients of the kind of guilty pleasure I love.,1002
"Pest, The","It seems to be targeted at eight-year-old boys with attention-deficit disorder, and could have been more competently made by any one of them.",1002

"Pest, The","Pass that can of Black Flag, hon.",1002

Con Air,"Gratuitous violence, glorious explosions, and mind-boggling action sequences abound in this maniacal thrill ride.",1016
Con Air,The saving grace of Con Air is its sense of its own absurdity. Rosenberg and director Simon West seem to know just how preposterous their story is.,1016
Con Air,It's exhausting rather than exhilarating.,1016
Con Air,"Packed high with explosive action and loaded with high-stakes jeopardy, Con Air charts a generally sound narrative course, although it hits some story turbulence before it hits its climactic jackpot.",1016

Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!,...nothing much of interest occurs...,1018
Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!,A curiously uplifting watch despite such a morose subject-matter.,1018
Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!,"Though this controversial film about romantic, sado-masochistic love in the hetero world is weak and ultimately disappointing, it's still worth seeing for understanding Almodovar's evolution.",1018
Die xue shuang xiong,"Christian imagery, from crucifixes to doves fluttering their wings in slow-motion, have long since become a hallmark of Woo's films regardless of their meaning, but these symbols immediately steep The Killer in a distinctly spiritual sense of remorse",1019
Die xue shuang xiong,Fun from start to finish.,1019

8 1/2,"Federico Fellini’s tale of an artist in crisis is such a universal statement to everyone who creates as a living, it has to be a must-own (and must-watch) for everyone.",1021
8 1/2,It clearly is an exquisite film that truly feels like a work of art.,1021
8 1/2,It could be said that the true beauty of “8 1/2” is found in its confusion. It’s found in the physical and psychological mayhem. It’s found in Fellini’s unique film language and audacious visual approach.,1021
8 1/2,"Of its importance there can be little question: it is a masterwork of one of the great filmmakers, his obviously definitive statement of creative doctrine. But it is an ""in"" movie, a strangely cold and uninvolving one for the nondevout.",1021
8 1/2,"With every screening, you discover more layers and further understand the film's purpose, and its filmmaker.",1021

Fire Down Below,Fire Down Below is an action film that's deadly slow and stupid -- like most of the mountain people portrayed in the film.,1025
Fire Down Below,"Marg Helgenberger plays Jack's love interest, the kind of tormented backwoodsy recluse Helen Reddy used to sing songs about. The stultifying aw-shucks courtship between the two is like a nightmarish version of 'The Bridges of Madison County'...",1025
Fire Down Below,"Unless you're in the market for boredom, skip this one.",1025
Fire Down Below,"As a movie, it's a piece of drivel.",1025
Fire Down Below,"You have to give Seagal points for having his heart in more or less the right place, but Fire Down Below is a hugely silly movie.",1025
Fire Down Below,Seagal barely works up a sweat... He certainly doesn't work up any drama.,1025
Fire Down Below,A by-the-numbers actioner that hits most of its marks.,1025
"Shooter, The",An unexciting bore.,1027
"Shooter, The","Shooter is a meat and potatoes kind of film, a good time. You can find plot holes, but to comment on them would be petty in light of the rest of the film's merits working with them.",1027
Grumpier Old Men,"It’s not quite as efficient as the first, but it’s much better than whatever the hell those reviews were in 1995. Those movie critics had no damn idea what was coming in the streaming age.",1028
Grumpier Old Men,Insults and sexual innuendo dominate routine comedy sequel.,1028
Grumpier Old Men,Moderately successful sequel. Lemmon and Matthau always a great team to watch.,1028
Grumpier Old Men,"Not as good as the first, but it's seldom less than amusing.",1028
Grumpier Old Men,"Nowhere near as funny as the first film. Just a stale, tired rehash.",1028
Grumpier Old Men,The heart of the first one is replaced by extra fart jokes.,1028
Grumpier Old Men,A wheezier replay of the 1993 hit geezer romp Grumpy Old Men.,1028
Grumpier Old Men,"This is, of course, a big-screen sitcom, and in fact I would love to see this material transplanted to the TV screen, where it belongs.",1028
Jury Duty,Movies are dumb. Pauly Shore is dumber. I'd rather watch O.J.,1029
Jury Duty,It's the audience that gets punished.,1029
Jury Duty,The smartest thing going for this dumdum comedy is that it opens while the real-life jury in the O.J. Simpson murder trial appears to be self-combusting.,1029
Jury Duty,"Disappointing, even for a Pauly Shore comedy. Not much satire, and the ending with the evil juror just makes no sense.",1029
Jury Duty,There isn't a laugh to be had in this mess.,1029
Jury Duty,"[Shore's] appeal must be limited to people whose self-esteem and social skills are so damaged that they find humor, or at least relief, in at last encountering a movie character less successful than themselves.",1029
Jury Duty,"The less said about this, the better.",1029
"Beverly Hillbillies, The","On The Beverly Hillbillies, what do I need to say? You know this redneck fable. There's more right than wrong here in Spheeris's take.",1030
"Beverly Hillbillies, The",It hurts to see such a gifted woman wasting her time in a relentlessly dumb movie.,1030
"Beverly Hillbillies, The","Unnecessary '90s remake has iffy humor, stereotypes.",1030
"Beverly Hillbillies, The","With films like these, it's a wonder studios still think it's a good idea to regurgitate the past.",1030
"Beverly Hillbillies, The",An endearing revival for TV's favourite hicks.,1030
"Beverly Hillbillies, The","Four writers worked on the script, and they all should hang their heads in shame.",1030
"Beverly Hillbillies, The","This big-screen expansion boasts one of the richest comic ensembles in recent memory, working well under Penelope Spheeris... About all that's missing is a point.",1030
"Beverly Hillbillies, The","It's thin stuff, but the ingratiating naivete of the characters and the aw-shucks friendliness of the cast are disarming, and it becomes easy to just let this go down as a country tune with some moonshine on the side.",1030
"Beverly Hillbillies, The",Director Spheeris should be ashamed of herself.,1030
"Beverly Hillbillies, The",Unbearable.,1030
Lassie,"Without a doubt, the best kind of family film that exists.",1031
Lassie,Lassie has finally come home -- Come home to the big screen and back into our hearts where she belongs.,1031
Lassie,Schmaltzy return for classic cinema canine.,1031
Lassie,"This story of a boy and his dog comes home to its roots in Yorkshire with a beautifully sensitive and traditional rendering. Using the original 1938 short story as its source, writer & director Charles Sturridge %u2013 best known for his superb work on Br",1031
Lassie,"Writer/director Charles Sturridge adapts the heart-warming story with strict attention to its modest emotional underpinnings of family, devotion, and a beautiful collie.",1031
Lassie,"An ode to the beleaguered people who face hardships, physical and emotional, with hopeful optimism.",1031
Lassie,"Dog and movie lovers, take note: Lassie has come home.",1031
Lassie,It's a welcome throwback to the carefully crafted family films of the studio era.,1031
Lassie,"A sweetly old-fashioned, tail-wagging charmer of a family film.",1031
Lassie,"Lassie dj vu filmed in the magnificent British Isles with more than enough animal stampedes to enthrall an entire theatre of ten year olds, and their parents.",1031
Little Big League,"Although funny in some spots, Little Big League slogs to a halt... This is a safe film for children and families. Its limitations come in redundancy and its oppressive length.",1032
Little Big League,The plot might be ridiculously absurd to an extent but Little Big League is one of the greatest baseball movies ever made.,1032
Little Big League,"Little Big League avoids the usual ending, but then tacks on an even more corny upbeat prologue.",1032
Little Big League,"Scheinman finds the spirit of the picture, playing up a remarkable situation with some down-to-earth writing and an enjoyable supporting cast.",1032
Little Big League,"As the fortunes of the Twins improve to put them in hot contention for the pennant, Little Big League gains a certain excitement. In setting out its personal stories, however, the screenplay and direction offer strictly minor-league material.",1032
Little Big League,"Passably entertaining for the ""Boy's Life"" crowd",1032
Little Big League,Forgettable in every way. The kids-in-big-leagues theme is thankfully dead for now.,1032
Little Big League,Another useless addition to a jam-packed genre,1032
Little Big League,"The first third or so of Little Big League is warm and winning - and has some big laughs. But as it progresses, the drama becomes more sentimental and stagnant, and the film begins to drag.",1032
Little Big League,"It's one of those rare baseball movies that has a real feel for the game, instead of using it as a backdrop for bizarre characters.",1032
Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco,"It's all pretty routine, and it's highly predictable, but the little ones giggled heartily at the screening I attended, and the parents were diverted.",1033
Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco,Definitely not as good as the first.,1033
Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco,"So pathetic, that the filmmakers are not above making gay jokes about animals in San Francisco!",1033
Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco,The tone is ideal for a family audience. The length is perfect. And the sequence of last-minute surprises elicits tears and laughter in just the right proportions.,1033
Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco,Somebody needs to invest in a few leashes.,1033
Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco,"This sequel is serviceable family-market fodder, but even little children might expect something more sophisticated these days.",1033
Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco,It does a better job than most family films in projecting a child's-eye view of a world where siblings and pets are equally cherished members of the family.,1033
Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco,"Like the first Homeward Bound, this one has some very nice elements, including wonderful camera work.",1033
Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco,"The first movie was good-hearted and I liked it, but since then Babe has raised the bar, with animals that not only talk more realistically, but say things that are wittier and more pungent.",1033
Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco,A silly little trifle with more wisecracks than laughs.,1033
Cool Runnings,"A brightly optimistic and warmly funny comedy, with solid performances and a no-nonsense visual approach that emphasises story over spectacle.",1035
Cool Runnings,... mildly amusing but overly calculated comedy...,1035
Cool Runnings,"Admittedly, it's a little predictable and patronising at times, but the eager performances of John Candy and his charges carry the day.",1035
Cool Runnings,"The performances are fun, and director John Turtletaub gets those fateful final moments right, leaving us with a triumphant, entertaining story of Winter Olympic glory.",1035
Cool Runnings,"[A] sweet-natured, high-spirited comedy, that rare movie that plays effectively to all ages.",1035
Cool Runnings,Cheesy? Certainly. But strong performaces and a heart-warming storyline make this a winner.,1035
Cool Runnings,"Though it certainly has faults, which only the extremely nostalgic could ignore, the film bests its contemporaries through its ability to unite childlike comedy and adult concerns without ever obscuring one with the other.",1035
Cool Runnings,Affable yet entirely forgettable...,1035
Cool Runnings,Cool Runnings is able to defy everything formulaic about sports movies and manages to rise up as a crowd-pleasing comedy.,1035
Cool Runnings,"While far from the best of Ritchie's portrayals of winning and losing (Downhill Racer, The Bad News Bears), Cool Runnings goes uphill, rather than down, and moves from bad news to good.",1035
Drop Dead Fred,"The crucial problem of course is that for a comedy, it's not really very funny.",1036
Drop Dead Fred,"Fred is a particularly crass, unappealing imaginary friend, going out of his way to stir up trouble more than engaging in fun activities.",1036
Drop Dead Fred,A fantastic cult comedy. [Full Review in Spanish],1036
Drop Dead Fred,"Drop Dead Fred is an erratic stab at making madness sensible, a slapstick nightmare that goes too sane, that tries too hard to be both good and rotten.",1036
Drop Dead Fred,This is easily one of the worst films I've ever seen.,1036
Drop Dead Fred,"The episodic flashbacks are cast in an unfunny Freudian light -- domineering mother, helpless hubby, the tragically withdrawn child. What a laugh riot!",1036
Drop Dead Fred,"That any of it, however, should suddenly, melodramatically lead to Elizabeth learning to assert herself is, to say the least, unpersuasive.",1036
Drop Dead Fred,"The movie is no comic masterpiece, but it is consistently amusing in a way that sometimes reminded me of a kiddie picture and at other times of a more sophisticated comedy.",1036
Drop Dead Fred,"It tries too hard to mimic Beetlejuice, especially in British comic Rik Mayall's frantic performance as the title character -- Mayall is no Michael Keaton -- but it has a whimsical comic energy.",1036
Drop Dead Fred,Drop Dead Fred is a movie for people who like the sound of fingernails on blackboards and the feel of a drill bearing into a bicuspid.,1036
Grease 2,"There is a gender-flipped gonzo goofiness to the film that was wildly ahead of its time in ’82 and, sadly, likely remains so today.",1037
Grease 2,"Grease 2 is a near-unmitigated failure: commercially, creatively, basically entirely.",1037
Grease 2,A kind of watered down version of a John Waters movie with unmemorable songs (but Tab Hunter's 'Reproduction' is a stand-out).,1037
Grease 2,"Grease 2 has somehow managed to pick up a decent amount of devotees over the decades, which makes me believe there must be hope for the likes of Battlefield Earth and The Hottie & the Nottie.",1037
Grease 2,"Besides the sad fact that the screenwriter (Ken Finkleman) had to carbon copy the original (perhaps he was forced to by Carr), many of the songs, while hummable, have innocuous lyrics that even high schoolers would find laughable.",1037
Grease 2,"Grease 2 might have catchy tunes that are few and far between but at the end of the day, it's just a gender-flipped remake of the predecessor and can't capture the same magic.",1037
Grease 2,A rather awful sequel to the mostly awful original.,1037
Grease 2,But here's the thing - Grease 2 will win you over with its unique approach to movie sequelry.,1037
Grease 2,"Its cast stuffed with old-school celebrities like Connie Stevens, Tab Hunter, Sid Ceasar and Eve Arden, its soundtrack cluttered with clunky new songs...",1037
Grease 2,"What I want from this material is a stylized rock musical, and what I keep getting are stale Broadway routines.",1037
Switchback,One wishes Quaid could loosen up enough to smile at least once.,1038
Switchback,"A superb, underrated drama",1038
Switchback,"High-class thriller, with a superb turn by Quaid",1038
Switchback,"A well-done suspense-thriller...Has modest aspirations, but meets them admirably.",1038
Switchback,"The striking American West setting enlivens this efficient, rote thriller.",1038
Switchback,"messily written and surprisingly poorly acted... the pursuit is a yawn a minute, leading to a climax that would be laughable if it weren't so dull.",1038
Switchback,"Switchback plays as entertaining, if not quite classic, dramatic fare.",1038
Switchback,Quaid is a one-note sadsack here and no natural action hero.,1038
Switchback,One wishes Quaid could loosen up enough to smile at least once.,1038
Switchback,"A superb, underrated drama",1038
Hamlet,At its best when incorporating text from the play with oddly appropriate gameplay. The intoning of Hamlet’s best-known soliloquy over footage of a bar in the game’s skid row really does look like something from a straight-up indie film of the play.,1039
Hamlet,"... What ultimately stays with you is the actor duo’s commendable ability to find inspiration and poetic gravitas in silliness, horseplay and tomfoolery, even (and especially) in the darkest of times.",1039
Hamlet,"Sam Crane and Pinny Grylls’ feature co-directorial debut is a riotously funny, unexpectedly poignant ode to gaming, Shakespeare, the indestructible nature of art, and the benefits of befriending bazooka wielding extraterrestrials.",1039
Hamlet,"This is an intriguing watch, and often a strikingly beautiful one: the artwork of the backdrops is a triumph.",1039
Hamlet,"For me, Oosterveen’s bewildered voice sounds very much like Simon Jones as Arthur Dent in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and I mean it as the highest possible praise when I say Douglas Adams would have loved this film. I certainly did.",1039
Hamlet,"Hamlet is about people pretending to be something they’re not; but the GTA version is perversely revealing: we may not know what the actors look like until the very end, but we know what’s haunting them.",1039
Hamlet,“Grand Theft Hamlet” is a marvelous journey into the hearts and minds of people seeking connection through a general sense of belonging during a time when humanity needed it most.,1039
Hamlet,"However, what makes this wickedly entertaining is how ridiculously amusing it is, and how such an incredibly stupid proposition ended up being so watchable.",1039
Hamlet,"Given that the actors-cum-gamers are operating in a virtual space with players from around the world, the film boasts several unexpected twists and a healthy dose of hilarity. However, the premise is ultimately more interesting than the actual execution.",1039
Hamlet,"Humans are a decidedly unserious lot, all things considered, and our need for play — for expressing joy — bonds us all.",1039
Two if by Sea,"This film will do nothing to displease the ever-growing legion of Sandra Bullock fans. It will, at the same time, add to the public recognition of Leary. It will, however, make no waves. It's merely a pleasant-enough time-waster.",1040
Two if by Sea,...partially watchable yet perpetually underwhelming...,1040
Two if by Sea,A good little movie -- emphasis on 'little.',1040
Two if by Sea,"It's disappointing to see Bullock reduced to rolling her eyes, putting her hand up and saying 'Talk to the hand' like a guest on Ricki Lake.",1040
Two if by Sea,"Completely lifeless, with zero chemistry between the leads.",1040
Two if by Sea,A relentlessly dreary and drippy romantic comedy cooked up for those who like their intimacy served with transparent schmaltz,1040
Two if by Sea,Sinks even before it gets started,1040
Two if by Sea,Sandra Bullock in a crappy romance is expected. Denis Leary starring in one is scary.,1040
Two if by Sea,"This film will do nothing to displease the ever-growing legion of Sandra Bullock fans. It will, at the same time, add to the public recognition of Leary. It will, however, make no waves. It's merely a pleasant-enough time-waster.",1040
Two if by Sea,...partially watchable yet perpetually underwhelming...,1040
Forget Paris,...an unabashedly old-fashioned romantic comedy that benefits from the charismatic efforts of its two stars...,1041
Forget Paris,"""When Harry Met Sally"" meets ""Sleepless in Seattle""",1041
Forget Paris,"Towards the end you wish they'd just get it over with, but this film usually overcomes even the most cynical viewer's resistance.",1041
Forget Paris,Some nice one-liners and a bit of good scenery help the story of a whirlwind romance that turns to salt when she later joins him Stateside.,1041
Forget Paris,A rather sour romantic comedy.,1041
Forget Paris,"Like the relationship it depicts, everything goes terribly slack in the middle.",1041
Forget Paris,Mr. Crystal's style as a director is smoothe and bland.,1041
Forget Paris,A very funny movie.,1041
Forget Paris,It's a funny and touching movie.,1041
Forget Paris,Um roteiro divertido que inova ao investir em um casal de protagonistas mais maduro do que o habitual.,1041
Just Cause,"Paced like a courtroom drama, with a devious plot featuring an above-standard presentation of hunting for clues, uncovering conspiracies, and interrogating witnesses.",1042
Just Cause,It'd be easy to just pop Just Cause in and enjoy it as a brisk thriller. But there are so many better thrillers out there to engage your adrenaline and your brain.,1042
Just Cause,"Connery is sadly lacking in vigour, and the script rarely sparkles. But the climax is cruelly effective.",1042
Just Cause,"...it's certainly impossible not to get a kick out of any film in which Sean Connery delivers the following line: ""If that's a confession then my ass is a banjo!""",1042
Just Cause,Good crime flick with strength in casting of Sean Connery.,1042
Just Cause,Connery is as steady as always....great twists,1042
Just Cause,Forgettable and less than thrilling.,1042
Just Cause,"Ridiculous from start to finish. Connery, Harris, and Fishburne couldn't have wasted their time in a less productive fashion.",1042
Just Cause,In Connery it has a hero who is inescapably appealing.,1042
Just Cause,"Despite its merits, the script fails to escape the silly season that fouls up so many thrillers, that time when the twists merely seem like the narrative equivalents of those violin shrieks on a cheesy score.",1042
"Paper, The",The Paper Tigers' snappy script and endlessly engaging ensemble cast imbue the film with its own singularly stirring spirit and show that you shouldn't count out the underdog.,1044
"Paper, The","“The Paper Tigers” is an entertaining watch — one that is uniquely pan-Asian, but sharply American in character. Though this feature may not keep you on the edge of your seat, it at least will make you laugh — and maybe even cry.",1044
"Paper, The","The actors bring The Three Tigers alive in a very convincing way. Their emotional journeys are at the very heart of this film, along with the code of conduct they have sworn to follow.",1044
"Paper, The","Tran adroitly layers the fight sequences, filmed with fluidity and at least substantially performed by the main actors themselves, between frothy layers of blokey banter.",1044
"Paper, The","The Paper Tigers doesn't stray too far from the conventional, but it delivers the right amount of humour and thrills to entertain even the most sceptical of audiences.",1044
"Paper, The","The Paper Tigers is a wonderful little kung-fu flick, with personal stakes, a fine cast, and a good amount of heart.",1044
"Paper, The",I think this is a movie you'll be happy you gave a chance.,1044
"Paper, The",It gets over because its fight scenes are surprisingly very entertaining and unpredictable.,1044
"Paper, The","The Paper Tigers weaves back and forth between comedy and drama throughout its runtime, and it does that weaving with grace and skill across multiple tempos.",1044
"Paper, The",Tran's film thrives as an infectious love letter to kung-fu cinema.,1044
Fearless,Bridges and Oscar-nominated Rosie Perez give heart-rending performances as plane-crash survivors and the film remains a painful reminder of just how fragile life really is.,1045
Fearless,"Director Peter Weir has given this study in post-traumatic shock syndrome, as the doctors call it, maximum emotional impact.",1045
Fearless,"Hamstrung by a key miscalculation and an unfortunate loss of nerve, it achieves a good deal but falls short of its own aspirations.",1045
Fearless,"A brilliant, daring film, starring actors at the very top of their game.",1045
Fearless,"An exploration of grief, PTSD, and how near-death experiences impact survivors. Rosie Perez deserves her acting nomination giving a raw heartbreaking performance.",1045
Fearless,"""Fearless"" is a powerful and provocative movie about, among other things, the dizzying possibilities of life after a near-death experience.",1045
Fearless,A bad movie that doesn't even serve as entertainment. [Full Review in Spanish],1045
Fearless,"Like the movie itself, Daviau's cityscapes are striking, mysterious and emotionally charged.",1045
Fearless,Both [Jeff] Bridges and [Rosie] Perez are exceptional in this movie that explores the stages of fear and what two people did to overcome them.,1045
Fearless,"In Fearless, fear-not just overcoming it, but experiencing it-connects us to our deepest selves, and to each other.",1045
Malice,"In its efforts to be unpredictable, the film instead becomes unbelievable.",1046
Malice,A melodramatic thriller which did surprisingly well in the US given its implausible straight-to-video scenario. Undistinguished.,1046
Malice,It's got suspense but no staying power.,1046
Malice,The only thing that makes this ludicrous botch even borderline watchable is Alec Baldwin's enjoyably supercilious performance as a leering stud surgeon who thinks nothing of belting back shots of bourbon before going in to perform an operation.,1046
Malice,Malice is a film that very much wants to be a combination of Body Heat and classic Hitchcock -- but how you take to it will depend on your patience with silly cliches and plot holes large enough to hide dinosaurs.,1046
Malice,"Offhand, this is the only movie I can recall in which an entire subplot about a serial killer is thrown in simply for atmosphere.",1046
Malice,"No matter how wild the plot reversals, there's always a slightly madder one to come.",1046
Malice,"The plot is twisty enough to keep you guessing through most of the film, but not all of it.",1046
Malice,The plot mechanics are well-oiled and above average for this type of vehicle.,1046
Malice,"Maybe it depends on how you feel about such intrusions but me, I don't welcome malice as my primary movie-going experience.",1046
Multiplicity,Well-acted and playfully superficial.,1047
Multiplicity,Multiplicity is more concerned with its special effects of multiple characters than any satisfying conclusion to its provocative premise.,1047
Multiplicity,"Some sexy stuff in dated, but entertaining '80s comedy.",1047
Multiplicity,"A desperately unfunny comedy lethargically directed by Harold Ramis, and boringly acted by Michael Keaton.",1047
Multiplicity,Try not to double or triple-up laughing. (published 7-19-96),1047
Multiplicity,It's a showcase for Keaton.,1047
Multiplicity,"Whatever you know about cloning, leave at the theater door. Whatever you know about the modern housewife, shuck that, too. The feminism of ""Multiplicity"" is barely circa 1959.",1047
Multiplicity,"More is not better, in this case.",1047
Multiplicity,"Michael Keaton is very funny, but the comedy itself isn't worth his efforts.",1047
Multiplicity,"Great premise, great work by Keaton, but the script lets them down.",1047
She's the One,…She’s The One is so firmly focused on the men that the female characters are treated abysmally…,1048
She's the One,She's the One is the perfect dating movie for those who are well over puberty and are out there on the front lines.,1048
She's the One,"She's The One is carefully observed, well-made, enjoyable, thought-provoking and even funny.",1048
She's the One,"A pleasant package then, easy on the eye, and gently charming but, like The Brothers McMullen, one which places Burns as a comfortable rather than cutting-edge moviemaker.",1048
She's the One,"A disappointing second feature from Ed Burns, the director of The Brothers McMullen.",1048
She's the One,"Burns manages to take on a laundry list of touchy issues in a relatively frank, unflinching manner. His characters retain their dignity and integrity without false dramatic redemption. It's a true adult saga.",1048
She's the One,Could be the best film Burns has ever done,1048
She's the One,"Burns' follow-up to 1995's witty ""The Brothers McMullen"" continues his wry examination of Irish machismo and its growing irrelevance in the '90s.",1048
She's the One,Ninety minutes and nobody got hurt...just the way I like it.,1048
She's the One,"A bland, so-so romantic comedy without the charm to see it through.",1048
House Arrest,"Borrowing liberally from both The Parent Trap' and The Great Escape, this misguided attempt at family farce rests on a couple of incompatible premises -- romantic matchmaking and imprisoned dispair.",1049
House Arrest,"When you scrape through the bottom of the comedy barrel and root around underneath it, this tedious morsel of drivel is what you will find.",1049
House Arrest,"The performances of both adults and youngsters are uniformly strong and, despite the occasional invasion of sentimentality, this makes for thoughtful entertainment.",1049
House Arrest,[A] predictable and sugarcoated (even criminally negligent) take on The Parent Trap.,1049
House Arrest,"To the slim degree that it qualifies as a comedy, House Arrest is a comedy with rank amateur pathos, and it's totally out of touch with its own superficially treated emotions.",1049
House Arrest,"Only Pollak and Curtis create any semblance of character in this tapestry of stereotype, but the movie doesn't give them enough to do as the louder idiots take to the fore with clumsily imagined escape gambits.",1049
House Arrest,"Parents of America: Beware! Should you choose to sit through this insufferable bit of high-concept fluff, you will feel as though you have been unlawfully detained for nearly two hours.",1049
House Arrest,A headache of a movie with a Parent Trap premise that quickly devolves into clamorous farce.,1049
House Arrest,Between the laughs beats a serious theme about the real victims in families pulled apart by lack of intimacy and the threat of divorce.,1049
House Arrest,"One of the year's worst movies... at least I hope so, or it's going to be a very bad year.",1049
"Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The","Less ghost story than romantic fantasy of impossible love, this moody classic from director Joseph Mankiewicz is a refreshingly mature and down to earth bittersweet romance.",1050
"Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The","Joseph Mankiewicz directs a film that effortlessly switches between gentle comedy and pathos, melodrama and fantasy. It’s a beguiling charmer.",1050
"Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The",The Ghost and Mrs. Muir is one of the most passionately romantic motion pictures I’ve ever seen.,1050
"Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The","The third act is astounding - a heavy-hitting, emotional, dreamy conclusion on par with epic romances like ""Wuthering Heights.""",1050
"Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The",The direction is smooth and the script has a relaxed good taste as it deals with piquant situations. Even the bit parts are played with distinction.,1050
"Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The","The film's whimsy is a bit heavy-handed and it is short on wit, style and ingenuity. Yet most of it is pleasant enough fun, and pretty to watch.",1050
"Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The","'The Ghost and Mrs. Muir' easily could have stumbled into melodrama or dramedy. It works as well as it does because of understatement, and it's still a charming and captivating film more than 60 years later.",1050
"Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The",[Tierney's] her somewhat stiff presence seems appropriate to the formality of the period while her astonishing beauty is only enhanced by the many layers of clothing women were expected to wear at the time.,1050
"Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The",Charming family classic is also thought-provoking.,1050
"Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The",It didn't move me as much as I think it should have.,1050
"Associate, The",Goldberg's unconvincing makeup looks like a cheap latex Halloween mask of a cross between Marlon Brando and the guy on the Quaker Oats box.,1051
"Associate, The","The farce promised by ""The Associate"" disappoints, but Goldberg and Wiest's sister act is surprisingly affirming.",1051
"Associate, The","If you were expecting Mrs. Doubtfire in reverse, invest your interest elsewhere.",1051
"Associate, The",An uninspired recycling of the Tootsie formula.,1051
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,"Though it brims with recognizable Brooks film regulars and his signature, lively genre send-ups, his schtick runs a bit dry with this latest production.",1052
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,Leslie Nielsen plays it too straight in Mel Brooks' alleged comedy...,1052
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,A very above par and often funny satire of a horror classic.,1052
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,"A few effective gags emerge from this hectic concoction of unfunny pratfalls, juvenile mugging and tedious enema jokes.",1052
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,Either this is the lamest Mel Brooks comedy ever or it's too close to other contenders to make much difference.,1052
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,"The only real sparks are set off by MacNicol as Renfield, the solicitor who develops a taste for flies and spiders after being bitten by Dracula.",1052
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,"Brooks, as Van Helsing, is one of the more successful aspects, but he hasn't imbued in his stock company a similar ability to rise above their underwritten roles.",1052
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,This Dracula spoof belongs dead.,1052
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,Another Mel Brooks stinker late in his career.,1052
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,Brooks spends so much time retelling the old Stoker legend that he hasn't enough time left for the necessary gags.,1052

Cronos,"Rightly acclaimed, the film boasts more than enough transcendent moments to secure its status as a modern horror classic.",1056
Cronos,Cronos is a haunting and heartwarming film in equal measure. This is a film about the importance of family and needing to make a choice to protect your family or live a longer yet forever changed life.,1056
Cronos,...a striking debut that feels long even at 94 minutes and would've worked a whole lot better as a short.,1056
Cronos,"That sort of horror is a lot more introspective and messier to dissect, but much like other films in Guillermo del Toro's oeuvre, Cronos is all the more existentially horrifying the longer it sits with you.",1056
Cronos,A really fun atmospheric little horror movie,1056
Cronos,A haunting little film that would augur greater successes such as Pan's and del Toro's 2001 masterpiece The Devil's Backbone.,1056
Cronos,"Cronos, the crafty debut of a young Mexican filmmaker named Guillermo del Toro, emerged as a warning shot. His tale of vampirism and immortality is half horror, half historical fable-like all the best del Toro work to come.",1056
Cronos,"From the prologue, it becomes clear that del Toro possesses an extraordinary vivid pictorial sense.",1056
Cronos,"It's part melodrama, part morality play and part thriller, more Dorian Gray than Bram Stoker and infused with a heady alchemic brew of ancient science, supernatural shadows, mutant organisms, demented villains...",1056
Cronos,Guillermo del Toro's feature debut is an arch twist on the vampire tale.,1056

"Pallbearer, The",Nice little rip-off of 'The Graduate.' Actually holds up on its own.,1057

"Pallbearer, The","The director, Matt Reeves, has a master plan, and it's amazing how a movie with so many detours can arrive so convincingly at its destination.",1057

Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood,"Perhaps if ""Menace'' had been shorter and some of the weaker sketches had been left on the cutting-room floor, it would have added up to a stronger whole.

"Adventures of Pinocchio, The",The filmmakers have created a pretty boring movie.,1060

"Adventures of Pinocchio, The","A lively and pleasant piece of work, one that likely will be a staple of video libraries in many households for years to come.",1060
"Adventures of Pinocchio, The",A bland reworking of the classic tale,1060

"Adventures of Pinocchio, The","Far from Disney, but still quite charming",1060
"Adventures of Pinocchio, The",Borderline-creepy live-action adaptation.,1060
"Adventures of Pinocchio, The","[It's] good, even very good at times. Unfortunately, some dumb, contemporary touches in dialogue and a couple of surprisingly sour musical numbers prevent it from being great.",1060

"Evening Star, The",Any crying in response to this unexceptional sequel occurs strictly on a one-tear-at-a-time basis.,1061

Four Days in September,"This is powerful stuff but, like so many political abduction dramas, suffers from a certain static quality.",1062
Four Days in September,"An intriguing, understated film that quietly brings up loud questions of honor, duty, ideals, and courage.",1062
Four Days in September,This low-key and highly intelligent Brazilian film set in 1969 deals with the complexities of political action.,1062
Four Days in September,I suppose the purpose of the film is to humanize both sides. It succeeds only to a degree. We can sense what the film wants to say better than the film can say it.,1062

"Little Princess, A","This new version of Frances Hodgson Burnett's children's classic boasts first-rate production values and a political sensitivity befitting the '90s, but it doesn't quite capture the magic of the 1939 Shirley Temple vehicle.",1063
"Little Princess, A","Cuaron finds the perfect style for this trusted formula; what could have been routine kids' stuff flourishes with his sure feeling for space, light and colour.",1063
"Little Princess, A","Soppy and girlish in the extreme, this should keep even the tiniest viewer rapt, while all too many adults may fall victim to an inexplicable bout of eye-watering long before the closing credits.",1063

Balto,"At one hour and 14 minutes, it's just about the right length.",1066
Balto,"'Balto' is touching, even if in very specific moments -, it is so much because of the honesty in those moments in which the drama is not covered by any extra layer. [Full Review in Spanish]",1066
Balto,"Kevin Bacon's voice turns the wolf-dog crossbreed into a no-nonsense hero with a sense of duty that far outweighs the pride of his deadly rival, Steele, while Bob Hoskins's eccentric Russian goose provides the comedy.",1066
Balto,"With no cheesy songs to slow proceedings down and some barnstorming chase sequences, this is enchanting, highly enjoyable and impressively crafted (not least for its adventurous ""camera work"") and would have made a pretty fair live action film.",1066
Balto,Brave dog saves kids in adequate fact-based film.,1066
Balto,"The goose and bears, in particular, don't add much to the proceedings, while Balto himself proves rather blandly heroic.",1066
Balto,The makers of this half-hearted animated feature let the story ramble on with a minimum of second-hand plotting and characterisation.,1066
Balto,"Avoiding the mythological grandiosity and freneticism that afflict so many animated features these days, ""Balto"" makes modesty a virtue.",1066
Balto,An Alaskan dog who gets a chance to demonstrate his courage and creativity on a mission of mercy.,1066
Balto,"Even as voiced by Bacon, Balto doesn't have the sort of charisma to get kids to truly root for him.",1066
Bottle Rocket,"In tone, style and content, this quirky little movie recalls the low-key comedies of Bill Forsythe (""Local Hero,"" ""Housekeeping""), the poet laureate of melancholy whimsy.",1067
Bottle Rocket,"Wes Anderson’s debut might lack the meticulous visual style he's synonymous with, but it's full of the charm and understated emotion we love him for.",1067
Bottle Rocket,...a thoroughly quirky yet mostly compelling comedy...,1067
Bottle Rocket,"Anderson hit the ground running with Bottle Rocket, a lovely heist film that showed the world exactly what he was capable of as a filmmaker.",1067
Bottle Rocket,"Bottle Rocket delivers an improvisational feel that few other films can capture. For an artisan so particular in his visual and emotional tone, it’s incredible to feel so free in his hands.",1067
Bottle Rocket,"Owen Wilson, with his buzz-blond do, smiling mug, and self-realizing spiel, is truly one of a kind.",1067
Bottle Rocket,"Though 1996's Bottle Rocket was a commercial flop, it was a remarkably special feature-length debut that introduced the world to the writer-director's idiosyncratic style.",1067
Bottle Rocket,"The performers look like they're having a lot of fun, but there is a great deal of skill on display.",1067
Bottle Rocket,"It's only in the finale of Bottle Rocket, brimming over with poignant male self-delusion, that the flair and sizzle of Anderson's future promise returns.",1067
Bottle Rocket,"A confident, eccentric debut about a trio of shambling and guileless friends who become the Candides of crime, Rocket feels particularly refreshing because it never compromises on its delicate deadpan sensibility.",1067
"Star Maker, The",A bittersweet tale of redemption that conveys the power of cinema and the soulful dimensions of storytelling.,1068
"Star Maker, The","The movie is not as special as Cinema Paradiso, but in its own way it is enchanted, too. Mother of God, what faces.",1068
"Star Maker, The","The central story, belatedly introduced, may prove rudely downbeat for viewers who lapped up Paradiso's sentiment.",1068

Living in Oblivion,"Slight but smart, and it doesn't overstay its welcome.",1070
Living in Oblivion,The segment in which Nick (Steve Buscemi) attempts to film a dream sequence (not unlike the famous one from TV's Twin Peaks) featuring a dwarf named Tito (Peter Dinklage) is worth the rental/purchase price alone.,1070
Living in Oblivion,"A hip indie version of Truffaut's Day for Night, Living in Oblivion celebrates the very act of filmmaking as grand folly, a triumph of absurdist heroism.",1070
Living in Oblivion,"DiCillo effectively uses dream sequences and black-and-white film to spoof the pretentiousness of indie films, but remains thoughtful and clever throughout. And every performance is spot-on.",1070
Living in Oblivion,Probably the best and funniest of the mid-'90s crop of movies about making movies.,1070
Living in Oblivion,"A valentine to the independent film world, DiCillo's version of Truffaut's Night for Day offers a smart, amusing look at the perils of low-budget filmmaking; the ensemble acting is superb.",1070
Living in Oblivion,A treat.,1070
Party Girl,Truly a movie for cool people who are also nerds.,1071
Party Girl,"As a portrait of early-mid-’90s New York City (and I was there), the film endures because it doesn’t insist on its own legacy.",1071
Party Girl,"Almost three decades later, the humor, designer fashion and music hold up, and the film tackles quarter-life challenges such as high rent and a lack of living-wage job opportunities without feeling pedantic or like an after-school special.",1071
Party Girl,No film has ever capitalized upon Posey's irresistible imperiousness better than 'Party Girl.',1071
Party Girl,"Parker Posey shines in 'Party Girl,' a capsule of the New York City 90s club scene",1071
Party Girl,Party Girl is an inspirational movie for any girl who feels both lost and found.,1071
Party Girl,"Mary is a spiritual descendant of Holly Golightly, and there's an echo, as well, of Edie Sedgwick, the late Andy Warhol superstar who moved the American-princess-on-a-bender mythology into the drug-rock era.",1071
Party Girl,Party Girl aspires to be cinematic champagne but comes out tasting more like sparkling cider.,1071
Party Girl,"The cast is uniformly excellent -- particularly the relentlessly effervescent Posey and the imperious Sasha von Scherler, the director's mother -- and the modern take on old-fashioned romantic comedy is surprisingly effective.",1071
Party Girl,"This exudes trendiness at regular intervals, and otherwise manages to be reasonably charming about Manhattan's melting pot culture, but my general response was still 'Wake me when it's over.'",1071
"Pyromaniac's Love Story, A","The cast is fine, the direction fluid, but the story wears you down.",1072
"Pyromaniac's Love Story, A",Goes down in a ball of flames,1072
"Pyromaniac's Love Story, A","A Pyromaniac's Love Story starts out like a lighthearted charmer, and then it goes on and on and on -- circling the same plot idea so doggedly that I began to wonder idly what it might have been like as a short subject.",1072
Shallow Grave,"Boyle's film bursts with energy and springs some deliciously macabre surprises, and he is rewarded with wonderful performances from Ewan McGregor, Christopher Eccleston and Kerry Fox, whose characters are all outwardly ordinary yet inwardly strange.",1073
Shallow Grave,"From the moment those electronic beats of Leftield start pounding on the soundtrack and Boyle’s camera begins racing around the cobbled streets of Edinburgh, the film announces itself as a propulsive thrill ride.",1073
Shallow Grave,A sour treat.,1073
Shallow Grave,"It presents a funny comedy that shifts into a bleakly amusing criminal caper, before descending into what is more or less a home invasion thriller.",1073
Shallow Grave,"It is not the narrative that is so new, but the way it is told.",1073
Shallow Grave,"Offering up such unlikable characters without apology is a risky move, but one that Shallow Grave manages to pull off.",1073
Shallow Grave,"Danny Boyle does wonders with a small budget, and the suave, dense-hued look of his movie stays with you long after the horror has evaporated.",1073
Shallow Grave,"What makes the film fascinating, and exciting, is its marriage of British setting and American, B-movie format. It is as if Edgar G Ulmer or Robert Siodmak had been reborn in Scotland.",1073
Shallow Grave,"The violence in the film, in particular, is briskly and harshly managed, without either half-heartedness or gloating. But a little further along, cogency starts falling apart for good.",1073
Shallow Grave,An almost astonishingly interminable thriller...,1073
Reality Bites,"For a lot of us Gen Xers, watching ‘Reality Bites’ now is like looking at an awkward yearbook picture of yourself when you had your worst haircut.",1074
Reality Bites,"As a depiction of a particular age in a particular country for a specific generation, it is still a pleasant nostalgic trip.",1074
Reality Bites,...a fairly by-the-numbers setup that's employed to impressively compelling (and relatable) effect by first-time filmmaker Stiller...,1074
Reality Bites,"The deeper themes of choosing art and integrity over earning a living . . . felt phony and hollow then, and are nothing short of embarrassing to watch from a modern perspective now.",1074
Reality Bites,Reality Bites is a legitimately good movie.,1074
Reality Bites,"A lot has changed between the generations, but Reality Bites asks a question that anyone, of any age, will find familiar: what happens when the life you were promised isn't the life you got?",1074
Reality Bites,"In a picture full of painful moments, it's hard to decide on the lowest point.",1074
Reality Bites,"Written with verve and played with grace, Reality Bites is too smart to pass itself off as a definitive statement, but it gets the details delightfully right.",1074
Reality Bites,"Gone is the fearless savagery Stiller smuggled into his TV series. Stuck between slacker and attacker, he settles for something curiously inert, slavishly mainstream and so hopelessly phony its own characters might make fun of it between bong rips.",1074
Reality Bites,Ryder and Hawke bring crucial authenticity to their roles with effortless appeal. You'll find yourself wanting more of these characters than the movie gives you.,1074
"Man of No Importance, A","...with the atmosphere of 1963 Dublin persuasively caught, A Man of No Importance is one of these lucky films that sees great talent well harnessed...",1075
"Man of No Importance, A",A slight but captivating film that is transformed into something special by Finney’s sweetly poignant performance.,1075
"Man of No Importance, A",I felt that more could have been done with such a good idea and such an excellent actor.,1075

"Man of No Importance, A","Although it is bittersweet, it is a feel good movie. I left the theater singing the happy song from the credits and feeling elated.",1075
"Pagemaster, The","The perfunctory prologue and epilogue, the unimaginative use of the literary sources, the mushy songs which Disney appears to have made obligatory and the lacklustre animation left me with little to do but bemoan missed opportunities.",1076
"Pagemaster, The","As the cartoon characters took over, the storyline slid predictably into place as we watched Richie battle dragons and learn a lesson about the ""meaning of life.""",1076
"Pagemaster, The","Narrated with a rhythm that prevents that one can get bored, the moral of 'The Pagemaster', which invokes the power of books and reading. [Full Review in Spanish]",1076

"Pagemaster, The",Weak Macaulay Culkin fantasy with some cartoon violence.,1076
"Pagemaster, The",Weak Macaulay Culkin fantasy with some cartoon violence.,1076
"Pagemaster, The","Built on a wispy premise better suited to the realm of TV, The Pagemaster plays like a slickly produced afternoon special.",1076
"Pagemaster, The",The film rests on its initial ingenuity and fails to develop the concept in interesting or surprising ways.,1076
"Pagemaster, The","Mediocre, really, this mixture of real actors and animation.",1076
"Pagemaster, The",A pallid film framed at the start and finish by live action and mostly composed of cheap-looking animation.,1076

Love and a .45,quite a BANG!,1077
Love and a .45,"Captures that Texas Rockabilly Highway Outlaw spirit . . . a bit silly and lags in places, but [it] puts the fun back into antisocial and homicidal behavior",1077
Oliver & Company,Oliver & Company is so concerned with creating a sense of energy that it loses focus on the fundamentals of what makes an enjoyable viewing experience.,1078
Oliver & Company,"The film's combination of a humorous script, fast pace, clever gags, superb casting of well-known voices and entertaining musical score make Oliver & Company the most enjoyable Disney film of the modern era for viewers of any age.",1078
Oliver & Company,"An instant children’s classic, along the lines of Lady and the Tramp and 101 Dalmatians. It’s heartwarming and entertaining, a thorough pleasure, even for very young children.",1078
Oliver & Company,"The Disney effort pulses with the beat of its urban setting. It moves briskly, stops now and again for an atmospheric interlude, then roars on with electric syncopation.",1078
Oliver & Company,"[Oliver & Company] boasts snappy songs, memorable voices and a story line that moves riotously if not smartly.",1078
Oliver & Company,"Ho-hum animation, ordinary characters and a plot that included the kidnapping and the terrorizing of a little girl leave one wondering if Disney can create even the slightest bit of its old magic.",1078
Oliver & Company,"Even if the mismatched singing and dancing weren't overly annoying, the character designs and plot are noticeably mediocre for the Disney standard.",1078
Oliver & Company,"Oliver & Company is, from start to finish, a joyride that's up there with the best Disney movies of all time.",1078
Oliver & Company,"I was entertained. The music is great. However, sections drag and there are too many bland characters.",1078
Oliver & Company,"The cartoon action will delight young children, while older ones, who usually reject animation as ""kid stuff,"" will enjoy the rock songs and hip characters, especially the brash Tito.",1078
Joe's Apartment,The musical comedy (or comedy with a few select songs) would burn into this reviewer’s brain to the point that a squeaky faucet lever or a rancid towel will immediately prompt me to burst into song.,1079
Joe's Apartment,"It's nicely realised, by human and roach alike, and something of a landmark in cinematic grossness.",1079
Joe's Apartment,"If it were even half as clever as the promotional web site -- which features such inventions as ROL, a parody of online service AOL -- it would be a small delight. But it's not.",1079

Joe's Apartment,'Less is more' is the lesson Hollywood often fails to learn.,1079
Joe's Apartment,"There are some isolated moments in this film that woudl make great shorts. Strung together with the rest of it, though, they just make a mess.",1079
Celestial Clockwork,"Nothing cuts very deep, and at times the film seems to be all over the place (Torres worked with five others on the script); but the surface glitter–aided by Ricardo Aronovich’s cinematography–keeps it fetching.",1080
Celestial Clockwork,"This film is an entertaining and colorful spectacle and with enough verve to make it seem inventive, even if it isn't.",1080
Celestial Clockwork,"Celestial Clockwork is a riotous carnival of music, colors, witchery, sexuality and magic. It's pitched at approximately the same level of seriousness as Flying Down to Rio, and if you approach it in that spirit, it's infectious and funny.",1080
Curdled,it's a golf joke that takes forever to get to the punch line,1081
Curdled,[Curdled] extends its thin idea to 94 minutes and tries to flesh it out with a story and characters who never seem convincing.,1081
Curdled,"For a black comedy, a little too heavy on the 'black' and too light on the 'comedy.'",1081

Female Perversions,I'm not sure I've ever seen nudity used as well in a film as it is in Perversions.,1082
Female Perversions,I could never warm up to any of the characters or their perversions or neuroses.,1082
Female Perversions,The women (played by Tilda Swinton and Amy Madigan) are so intriguing and complex that they almost overcome the trappings of a non-linear narrative that's borderline academic.,1082
Female Perversions,The result is short on plot but long on observational detail and psychological resonance.,1082
Female Perversions,"Humorless and swathed in symbolism, it taunts us with cerebral puzzles that we may not care to solve.",1082
Female Perversions,"Even if it works better as a provocative psychological treatise than as art, it does come alive and does provide major roles for Tilda Swinton and Amy Madigan.",1082
Female Perversions,Often too pretentious to be profound.,1082
Female Perversions,A richly textured movie that demands a second viewing to comprehend it all.,1082
Female Perversions,This is the kind of movie you can't stop thinking about.,1082
Albino Alligator,One of Spacey's most notable achievements is that he's managed to tease out that rare treasure: a great Matt Dillon performance.,1083
Albino Alligator,"Christian Forte's script starts a little shakily, but it finds its feet once it has stopped trying to be Dog Day Afternoon, heading squarely into David Mamet territory.",1083
Albino Alligator,"This preposterously plotted, ineptly helmed film features the emabrrassing directing debut of actor Kevin Spacey, wasting the talents of Matt Dillon, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen, Joe Mantegna, Faye Dunaway, and others.",1083
Albino Alligator,"Sleek, efficient thriller.",1083
Albino Alligator,"Above average thriller with solid cast, but thinks it's more clever than it is.",1083
Albino Alligator,Christian Forte's script is top-notch.,1083
Albino Alligator,"Pretentious and show-offy, the noirish drama fairly reeks of film-student overkill.",1083
Albino Alligator,The enterprise seems contrived -- more like an actors' workshop than a drama.,1083
Albino Alligator,One of Spacey's most notable achievements is that he's managed to tease out that rare treasure: a great Matt Dillon performance.,1083
Albino Alligator,"Christian Forte's script starts a little shakily, but it finds its feet once it has stopped trying to be Dog Day Afternoon, heading squarely into David Mamet territory.",1083
Anne Frank Remembered,The memory of Anne Frank haunts us 50 years after her death. But it is the simple humanity (and unassuming bravery) of Miep Gies that makes Anne Frank Remembered a truly unforgettable experience.,1084
Anne Frank Remembered,Powerful look at the Holocaust through teen eyes.,1084
Anne Frank Remembered,"New insignts about Anne's spicy personality and immense curiosity are revealed by Holocaust survivors Hanneli Goslar and particularly Miep Gies, an office employee of Anne's father who was one of the main helpers to the families in hiding.",1084
Anne Frank Remembered,A great documentary selection for college film series audiences.,1084
Anne Frank Remembered,Pays tribute to her heroic spirit which stands for all the Jewish youth who were never allowed to grow up and savor the fullness of life.,1084
Anne Frank Remembered,"Just when you might well have thought that pretty much all had been said and done about Anne Frank, this film makes us realize how much there still is to know about her and her times.",1084
Anne Frank Remembered,A beautifully made look at one child's brief life.,1084
Anne Frank Remembered,"Remarkable, deeply moving work that attempts to answer the haunting question, Who was Anne Frank?",1084
Anne Frank Remembered,"If the story of each of Hitler's victims was told with the sensitivity and power of Anne Frank Remembered, there would not be enough buckets in the world to hold all the tears.",1084
Anne Frank Remembered,The interviews constitute the emotional backbone. The mere existence of these survivors is eloquent testimony to events so cruel they defy belief.,1084
Carried Away,"Hopper and Irving are wonderfully understated and compelling, while Locane lends her character a sense of simmering instability that drives the plot.",1085
Carried Away,"I wasn't carried away with this Lolita like cautionary tale, but I was impressed enough by its intelligent presentation.",1085
Carried Away,"Tries to incorporate almost film-noir elements into a heartland love story. The blending feels inorganic; and composer Bruce Broughton doesn't help matters by coating every moment with a repetitive, syrupy theme.",1085
Carried Away,A very dry and formulaic re-telling of a cautionary tale we know all too well by now.,1085
Carried Away,Carried Away is a brilliant evocation of rural life and repressed lust. One of the ten-best films of 1996.,1085
Carried Away,A mature Irving gets naked for her husband.,1085
Carried Away,"A chilling, Lolita-like drama that's elevated by a terrific performance by Hopper.",1085
Carried Away,An earnestly well-meaning film whose adult characters have a refreshingly grown-up perspective on their choices in life.,1085
Carried Away,"The performances are captivating, so much so that the film's sometimes slow pace is never a real problem.",1085
Carried Away,"Director Barreto has a fine eye for composition and a knowing heart for human emotion, keeping things simple and sparse.",1085
It's My Party,The story is so heartwarming and sincere.,1086
It's My Party,"This chronicle of a person with AIDS who decides to terminate his life while his faculties are still intact feels like a personal work, but it's all background detail, lacking a strong dramatic core",1086
It's My Party,a powerful experience.,1086
It's My Party,Any movie trying this hard to get me misty is a lot more likely to make me angry.,1086
It's My Party,A powerful and moving film,1086
It's My Party,"This Party has its funny, sad and awkward moments. But at the end, you'll be glad you went.",1086
It's My Party,"It's more three-dimensional and realistic, showing how death, for all of its sadness, can sometimes create joy, if people are given the opportunity to affirm what they feel for one another.",1086
Double Team,The pinnacle of suck.,1088
Double Team,Exactly as bad as you'd imagine a Van Damme-Rodman collaboration to be.,1088
Double Team,"A gimmick movie, worth a look on cheap rental night.",1088
Double Team,"Rodman is more fun to watch here than either co-star, given his array of earrings and nose rings, plus hair that changes color more frequently than the first lady changes her do.",1088
Double Team,Van Damme was better in such earlier films as Timecop and Sudden Death because he had more to do: Here he's at the mercy of the jam-packed plot.,1088
Double Team,"If you're honestly wondering whether this film is any good, I can't help you.",1088
Double Team,The talent of the director is not quite enough to make up for the minimal ability exhibited by some of the other people working on the production.,1088
Speed 2: Cruise Control,A seriously inferior sequel...,1089
Speed 2: Cruise Control,"This is probably as good a time as any to point out that Orson Welles scrounged for budgets all his life, yet studios routinely throw $110 million at crap like ""Speed 2.""",1089
Speed 2: Cruise Control,"This Keanu Reeves-less sequel is masked by its commitment to non-stop action and entertainment, that you're almost distracted from its shortcomings, of which there are many.",1089
Speed 2: Cruise Control,"Instead of action or suspense, Cruise Control delivers dumb comedy riddled with continuity errors and a complete lack of spatial-temporal logic.",1089
Speed 2: Cruise Control,"Willem Dafoe, though effective in nearly every villain role, is a bit overdone as a psychopath with a penchant for leech therapy.",1089
Speed 2: Cruise Control,"They spent double, maybe even four times as much as they did on Speed...and it's terrible.",1089
Speed 2: Cruise Control,"They truly ruined a whole franchise in just two movies...never seen something like this, can't even reboot it now...",1089
Speed 2: Cruise Control,It's not really worth sinking your time and money into. This movie is more floundering than fun.,1089
Speed 2: Cruise Control,An ear-splitting amusement-park attraction posing as a movie.,1089
Speed 2: Cruise Control,"First, the good news: Unlike most action film sequels, Speed 2: Cruise Control is not a mere retread of the original. Now the bad news: Better it had been.",1089
Sliver,"The cast may have been high-profile, but Sliver is no great work of art.",1090
Sliver,"Bogged down by dialogue by the vaunted Joe Eszterhas that utterly fails in its attempts at chic Manhattan wit, Sliver proceeds at an escargot pace to unfold the creepy happenings.",1090
Sliver,"Sharon Stone goes cold in this botched thiller-maybe from the effort of pretending that her character, a beauteous book editor, would fall for the preening young computer wizard played by the vacant-and-proud-of-it William Baldwin.",1090
Sliver,...a slow-moving erotic thriller that nevertheless remains relatively watchable for the duration of its runtime...,1090
Sliver,Director Phillip Noyce's camera will leer at anything that clenches and unclenches with a steady rhythm.,1090
Sliver,"A glossy, trashy psychological thriller that manages to entertain despite a reshot ending which is too abrupt.",1090
Sliver,"A hot follow-up to ""Basic Instinct""....just as sizzling",1090
Sliver,Horrible.,1090
Sliver,Stone and Noyce fall from grace.,1090
Sliver,"'You like to watch don't you'... that may be true, but I would have liked watching even more if I were watching something better.",1090
Pete's Dragon,"In what can only be considered a truly mediocre summer movie season, Pete’s Dragon emerges with honesty and authentic beauty, and carries that beauty on its wings as it flies forward.",1091
Pete's Dragon,There’s an authentic gentleness to the story and a joyous thrill to the bucolic adventure.,1091
Pete's Dragon,"Nothing about the film feels forced or overstated, and even the most predictable of plot machinations feel authentic under Lowery's capable direction.",1091
Pete's Dragon,"Elliott's lovable and heartbreaking, another masterful sim from BFG animators Weta Digital.",1091
Pete's Dragon,"David Lowery taking on a remake of Pete’s Dragon at the height of his creative achievement was always a curious choice, but he just nailed this delightful adaptation that transcends the 1970s original.",1091
Pete's Dragon,"In a summer full of remakes and sequels, Disney's latest live-action take on an animated classic exudes a breath of fresh mountain air and leads us to believe in Elliot, the Millhaven Dragon.",1091
Pete's Dragon,"The gentle nature and leisurely pace might cause a few Coked out kids to fidget, but most should react positively to the picture's sense of adventure and discovery.",1091
Pete's Dragon,"It is relatable to watch as an adult, it is fantastical and adventurous for a child, and it needs no frills or shocks to make it good.",1091
Pete's Dragon,It's the kind of subject matter - and production - that could inspire a decent theme park ride more than one's imagination or sense of wonderment.,1091
Pete's Dragon,A film to be adored by parents and children alike.,1091
Dear God,"Garry Marshall's fast-paced, Capra-esque comedy probably out-Capras Capra himself in sentimentality, but the terrific cast makes for a rarity: a feel good-comedy that's actually very funny.",1092
Dear God,"It unfortunately has an unfinished quality, and plays very much like a good first draft for a much better movie than the one on view.",1092
Dear God,Horrendously unfunny.,1092
Dear God,Annoyingly unfocused comedy flick with nary a laugh to be found.,1092
Dear God,"Cute concept, middling execution.",1092
Dear God,This shows Greg Kinnear at his most forced. Director Garry Marshall should've given Kinnear and the other actors more depth before taking it to the silver screen.,1092
Dear God,Cutesy comedy that makes good use of the Kinnear charm.,1092
Dear God,"Together, these characters discover the ideas of faith and fellowship as the film congratulates itself on its noble instincts.",1092
Dear God,Ultimately what we have here is further evidence of just how difficult it is to make a film that works.,1092
Dear God,Dreadful,1092
Live Nude Girls,Kim Cattrall's encounter with a young delivery man is almost alone worth the price of admission.,1093
"Thin Line Between Love and Hate, A",Whitfield makes the movie interesting.,1094
"Thin Line Between Love and Hate, A",A thin line? Not in this case.,1094
"Thin Line Between Love and Hate, A","Tiresome stuff, bearable only if you can overlook the questionable premise and find something to like in Lawrence's Eddie Murphy-lite turn.",1094
"Thin Line Between Love and Hate, A",Sluggishly paced and too seldom funny...,1094
"Thin Line Between Love and Hate, A","The script lacks wit and depth, while Lawrence's direction is meandering and undramatic, full of showy, over-elaborate camera movements.",1094
"Thin Line Between Love and Hate, A","A ponderous vanity project that is unfunny and, worst of all, just plain boring.",1094
"Thin Line Between Love and Hate, A","Too serious to be a comedy, too flippant to be a thriller, it often feels like a backhanded act of penance for the misogynist humor in the star's comedy act.",1094
"Thin Line Between Love and Hate, A","[Lawrence is] a charming, gifted comic with a killer smile, but he's way out of his depth in this Fatal Attraction knockoff, which he also co-wrote and stars in.",1094
"Thin Line Between Love and Hate, A","In showing the importance of monogamy, the film is profound enough that it could lead couples to reevaluate themselves; women will look at their new men a bit more quizzically, and men will be less likely to say ""I love you"" unless they mean it.",1094
"Thin Line Between Love and Hate, A","Any movie with a bar called Chocolate City can't be all bad, right?",1094
High School High,"'High School High' may push the envelope a little too far at times, but you won't be able to hold back the tears from laughing so hard. The first 30 minutes are pure gold!",1095
High School High,"Does drive home a few laughs, but not nearly as many as the Zucker name would lead you to believe.",1095
High School High,"High School High has one or two genuine laughs with several chuckle-worthy moments peppered throughout, but this is pretty much a lackluster effort.",1095
High School High,One joke movie that's one joke too long,1095
High School High,The normally riotous Lovitz flunks the test in this farcical school daze. There's nothing remotely academic about Bochner's High School High,1095
High School High,"Strings together hilarious series of gags at the beginning and end, but in the middle High School High makes the mistake of having a story.",1095
High School High,"The movie makes two mistakes: (1) It isn't very funny, and (2) it makes the crucial error of taking its story seriously and angling for a happy ending.",1095
High School High,"Except for dated homages to Deer Hunter and Rebel Without a Cause, High tries to squeeze guffaws out of the crumbling educational system, not exactly gut-buster material.",1095
Commandments,"The epic qualities of De Mille’s last directorial endeavor are impossible to ignore; consistently entertaining or not, the grandeur and scope are monumental.",1096
Commandments,Great fun. This lovably corny Biblical epic is always entertaining no matter when you tune in on Easter night.,1096
Commandments,The whole experience (with an interval) lasts roughly four hours. I am afraid that long before the time was up I was silently imploring Mr. DeMille to let his people go.,1096
Commandments,"...De Mille places each actor and drapes each Edith Head gown with such fastidious pride it's as if the hands of history, if not God himself, were responsible.",1096
Commandments,"It is all a grandly unrestrained act of regression to the infantile days of the cinema, which DeMille seems never to have outgrown.",1096
Commandments,"Whatever its dramatic and religious shortcomings, the film grapples -- and often tellingly -- with subject matter of great importance for this or any year.",1096
Commandments,"Cecil B. DeMille set out not just to be entertaining but to do as much justice to the Moses saga as he could, with as much awe and pomp and grandeur as the Fifties studio system could muster. He succeeded spectacularly.",1096
Commandments,"As The Ten Commandments hits its sixty-fifth anniversary, it is once again being celebrated and has been given a true makeover.",1096
Commandments,The Ten Commandments may have been impressive for its time but the film horribly fails in its attempt to recreate the story of the Exodus.,1096
Commandments,"Staggering as spectacle and inspirational as a Biblical tale, but it has to labor mighty hard to overcome the lamentable dialogue (""Oh, Moses, Moses, you stubborn, splendid, adorable fool!"") and the poor acting by virtually all of its leading players.",1096
Hate,10 Things I Hate About You has become a cult classic in the past 25 years because it nailed the universal truth about stereotypes: there’s always more to them than what’s seen on the surface.,1097
Hate,10 Things I Hate About You — a modernized version of William Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew — has everything you could want from a teen rom-com.,1097
Hate,"Marvelous set pieces contribute to this lively romantic comedy. You don't have to be a Shakespearean scholar to enjoy it. You don't have to be a teenager, either.",1097
Hate,"What 10 Things I Hate About You could have used, besides a less contrived teen title, is more teen laughs.",1097
Hate,"Gil Junger's clever direction, which uses peripheral action tellingly, keeps this loose revision of The Taming of the Shrew lively throughout. But though he has engaging counterparts for Katherina and Petruchio... Kiss Me Kate it ain't.",1097
Hate,"In terms of Shakespearean scholarship, ""10 Things,"" directed with more energy than style by Gil Junger, may be but a footnote. But when they write the teen-flick book, this goes to the front of the class.",1097
Hate,"Who knew that Shakespeare dude could be so entertaining? References to him abound in this messy but enjoyable movie right down to the use of a remake of Nick Lowe's ""Cruel to Be Kind."" But you don't have to be a fan of the Bard to like this affable film.",1097
Hate,"""10 Things"" has trouble being one thing. It's neither Shakespeare nor John Hughes, but falls into a fizzy middle ground.",1097
Hate,"Okay, I won't complain about the plot, but the dialogue is painfully witless, and there are more supposedly dramatic moments when a girl slams a door than should be legal in a 90-minute film.",1097
Hate,"Smartly written, lofted into orbit by a heads-up ensemble performance, it's bursting with new talent on both sides of the camera.",1097
Flirting With Disaster,"Russell’s deceptively wise film sustains those insane, out-of-touch moments of behavior and prolongs them, making the experience torturously funny, but rewarding on multiple levels.",1098
Flirting With Disaster,"The results are watchable enough–sometimes funny, sometimes over the top–and fairly fresh, though also a bit calculated. Leoni has an interesting comic presence one would like to see in toothier material, though this certainly has a few bites.",1098
Flirting With Disaster,It's a hilarious lesson about accepting your family no matter how crazy they may be.,1098
Flirting With Disaster,It's well worth the trip that this wacky lot maps.,1098
Flirting With Disaster,"An immaculately constructed Rube Goldberg device that accumulates comic energy and speed as it reaches its finale, built from social and emotional hypocrisies we use to try and paper over our vices. It's what Russell does now, only far less serious.",1098
Flirting With Disaster,"It's a road movie, and a family comedy, and neurotic Woody Allen-style rom-com, but none of those crisp, compact boxes can properly contain this wild, strange, unruly picture.",1098
Flirting With Disaster,David O. Russell has a twisted mind; I like that in a man.,1098
Flirting With Disaster,"This whacked-out road comedy about a young man's search for his real parents takes any number of unexpected turns, most of them bitingly funny.",1098
Flirting With Disaster,Entertainment for the whole dysfunctional family.,1098
Flirting With Disaster,"Boasting a clever title, this is an inspired piece of lunacy about sociology versus biology, with terrific performances from Ben Stiller and his two sets of parents.",1098
"Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker","At first the film seems to ape the intense allegorical style of Zhang Yimou, but then it veers off into an overwrought, rather silly melodrama.",1099
"Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker",The film is further evidence of the strength of the new Chinese cinema.,1099
"Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker",Well-told tale that registers effectively on the senses.,1099
"Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker",A visually stunning new Chinese film with a shamelessly melodramatic plot.,1099
What Happened Was...,"This film is thought provoking, unsettling and what Noonan manages to do with a single space is incredible.",1100
What Happened Was...,"Oscilloscope's 4K scan of an original 35mm print issued on blu-ray, the first time this 1994 Sundance winner...has been made available in a DVD format, is cause for celebration...Tom Noonan delivered his magnum opus right out of the gate.",1100
What Happened Was...,A largely forgotten triumph from the margins of the mid-90s Sundance boom.,1100
What Happened Was...,"This intense, mysterious drama about a date between two lonely misfits, is sensitively directed by Tom Noonan, better known as an actor; it was the surprise winner of the Grand Jury Prize of the 1994 Sundance Film Festival.",1100
What Happened Was...,More like a bad real first date than a movie.,1100
What Happened Was...,Absorbing character-based drama that yields plenty of nuances and variations on its simple premise.,1100
What Happened Was...,A darky amusing but sadly poignant look at dating and deception.,1100
What Happened Was...,Brilliantly executed psychodrama about all the emotions that come to the fore in dating.,1100
What Happened Was...,"There are many small moments of perfect observation. But I never really felt they were building to anything, or heading anywhere.",1100
What Happened Was...,This one really moves and breathes.,1100
Six Degrees of Separation,"Six Degrees of Separation is a bit intellectual for a mass audience, but it's got some very funny moments and is loaded with thought-provoking social satire.",1101
Six Degrees of Separation,"It was the first major film role for Will Smith, and some would say that despite the star he has become in years since, this early role is still his best.",1101
Six Degrees of Separation,"A mystery wrapped inside an enigmatic nation, flawlessly acted and difficult to predict. I'm always impressed when a movie informs about a foreign culture while it entertains, and this one is powerful art in that regard.",1101
Six Degrees of Separation,"A rare sight: a sharply observed Hollywood satire of poignant ideas, such as opportunities in life, achieving fame in American society, and how we all are in one way or another con men.",1101
Six Degrees of Separation,"It walks like a play and talks like a play, but thanks to the gentle direction and the performances from the crack cast -- particularly Channing and a never-better Smith -- it's satisfying as a movie.",1101

Two Much,Too much to endure,1102
Two Much,"Too Much is a screwball comedy in every ounce of its being. A bad one, true, but screwball all the same.",1102
Trust,Characters don’t dialogue with each other so much as trade ham-fisted buzzwords. The acting ranges from wooden to wildly over the top. The religious and political arguments are lazy and surface level.,1103
Trust,"God’s Not Dead: In God We Trust entertained me to some extent. ... However, I found both the theological and political perspectives disappointing.",1103
Firestorm,"Hokey smoky. That just about sums up Firestorm, a not-so-towering inferno of action nonsense and overheated mayhem.",1105
Firestorm,...boasts an old-fashioned sensibility that benefits from several surprisingly thrilling set pieces...,1105
Firestorm,"No one should mistake Firestorm for a ""quality"" motion picture. It's not, and it wasn't designed to be.",1105
Firestorm,"In movies, as in life, you take your warmth where you can find it, but this particular wienie roast is bound to leave you cold.",1105
Firestorm,It is just a run-of-the-mill action movie.,1105
Firestorm,"Put it this way: Long is Olivier compared to the last ex-pro football player to try his hand at the silver screen, Brian Bosworth.",1105
Firestorm,"When the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires, the simulated ones look hokey.",1105
Firestorm,"It's fast, simple-minded action with a lot of corny dialogue, preposterous circumstance and good looking people.",1105
Firestorm,This film isn't apt to light your fire and it's doubtful it will ignite much action at the box-office.,1105
Firestorm,"Hokey smoky. That just about sums up Firestorm, a not-so-towering inferno of action nonsense and overheated mayhem.",1105
"Newton Boys, The","Better than its ads would lead you to believe, but it’s a vague and mostly uninvolving film.",1106
"Newton Boys, The","What the film communicates perhaps above all is Linklater's deep belief in the resiliency and ingenuity of human beings, his confidence in their ability to resist, by whatever means at their disposal, unfair and unjust conditions.",1106
"Newton Boys, The","As portrayed by Matthew McConaughey in his first fully satisfying screen performance, Willis Newton regards his three younger brothers and their associates as social rectifiers who take money only from the real thieves: bankers and their directors.",1106
"Newton Boys, The",A handsome production that nicely evokes the 1920s and a likeable cast headed by McConaughey can't compensate for a Western-gangster film that's too diffuse and lacks a discernibel POV to be dramatically engaging.,1106
"Newton Boys, The","Like the Newtons themselves, the film never goes for the kill.",1106
"Newton Boys, The",Linklater seems to understand the root of McConaughey's appeal stems from his wild side. Casting McConaughey as someone noble and high-minded... is like hiring Madonna to play a housewife.,1106
"Newton Boys, The","There's little nuance in the straightforward, chronological way the tale is told--it's hard to point to a scene that's worth discussing after you've left the theatre.",1106
"Newton Boys, The",Linklater's genuine regard for his characters and fidelity to his setting are his strongest directorial traits.,1106
"Newton Boys, The","We're hanging out with them more than we're being told a story. There are a lot of conversations about the profession of bank robbery -- which, as a topic for conversation, is not a whole lot more interesting than double-entry bookkeeping.",1106
"Newton Boys, The","Better than its ads would lead you to believe, but it’s a vague and mostly uninvolving film.",1106
Beyond Rangoon,"The movie artfully appeals to some of the more hypocritical parts of my liberal conscience and gives them a gentle workout, but it doesn’t really change anything–except the bank accounts of a few studio executives...",1107
Beyond Rangoon,...earnest yet hopelessly underwhelming...,1107
Beyond Rangoon,John Boorman's Beyond Rangoon is a humane and technically accomplished drama set in the viciously repressive world of contemporary Burma.,1107
Beyond Rangoon,"Arquette gives the kind of mighty physical performance usually delivered by men in existential action classics like ""The Wages of Fear,"" but she suffuses it with something all her own-she's bulletproof yet vulnerable.",1107
Beyond Rangoon,"Do artists, and those who style themselves as artists, have the right to lie to further their visions?",1107

Beyond Rangoon,About an American doctor in Burma who discovers the wild woman inside as she squares off against incredible physical and mental challenges.,1107
Beyond Rangoon,"This is a perennial favorite because of the scenery (it's set in Burma, shot in Malaysia), because of the strong heroine, and because of the mix of politics and adventure.",1107
Feast of July,"Feast of July in movie form suffers from the same weakness as the H.E. Bates novel on which it is based. To wit: For all its melodrama, sexual tension and violence, the story is a bore.",1108
Feast of July,"an extraordinarily difficult to follow film, full of talky, dull melodrama and the glamorization of ""proper"" 19th century sensibilities",1108
Feast of July,My problem with the film was that none of the characters is really interesting.,1108
Death and the Maiden,"Miss Weaver plays the victim with quite astonishing intensity, and deals with Mr. Kingsley in a manner that is quite convincing.",1109
Death and the Maiden,Polanski manages to size the fundamental components of the mystery and suspense so that the atmosphere of the film is sinister in some scenes. But what I see hardly captivates me. [Full review in Spanish],1109
Death and the Maiden,It's based on the gripping three-character play by Ariel Dorfman.,1109
Death and the Maiden,"Even by their high standards, the performances of Weaver and Kingsley here are impressive, and Polanski ratchetts up the tension nicely. A chilling and thought-provoking piece.",1109
Death and the Maiden,"The material is well served by director Roman Polanski, who knows well how to instill a subtle, claustrophobic sense of dread in an audience and has put together a rather elegant potboiler.",1109
Death and the Maiden,"Polanski certainly gets the maximum voltage and precision out of his story and actors, keeping us preternaturally alert to shifting power relationships and delayed revelations.",1109
Death and the Maiden,"Kingsley shrewdly tantalizes the viewer about his identity, and gets to deliver the text's most riveting monologue at the end. The lesser-known Wilson may be the first among equals, impressing strongly as the equivocating husband.",1109
Death and the Maiden,Polanski kicks the movie up to a level of emotional violence rare in English-speaking films.,1109
Death and the Maiden,"Polanksi's direction is crisp and precise but he doesn't resolve basic problems of the stage-to-screen transfer: The tale is claustrophobic (mostly limited to one set) and schematic, with all three characters serving as ideological mouthpieces.",1109
Death and the Maiden,"A relentless, superb thriller.",1109
Tank Girl,"In bringing to life the comic book of the same name by Alan Martin & Jamie Hewlett, Talalay incorporates bombastic action, cartoon violence, a bold color palette, and even traditional hand drawn animation into a unique world all its own.",1110
Tank Girl,"Tank Girl posit that when a civilization collapses, many of its customs will be upheld through authoritarian means, shorn of any patina of justice or equity that may have been affirmed through the sanctioning of the democratic event.",1110
Tank Girl,I found it entertaining in a pleasingly odd way.,1110
Tank Girl,"The movie is hyperactive and generally a lot of fun, with a kick-ass soundtrack supervised by Courtney Love and imaginatively cluttered production design by Catherine Hardwicke.",1110
Tank Girl,"Tank Girl failed critically and commercially, a badge of honor for a mid-90s postapocalyptic-feminist-punk carnival",1110
Tank Girl,"Courtney Love coordinates the film's soundtrack, which only adds fuel to film's frenetic fire.",1110
Tank Girl,"Partly rebellious, partly playful, but mostly an irreverent, chaotic take on non-supernatural superheroes, it sacrifices entertainment value for hyperstylized originality.",1110
Tank Girl,"With climate change going unchecked and drinking water shortages abounding, 'Tank Girl' predicted a totally possible post-apocalypse scenario.",1110
Tank Girl,It may not be great art but it still makes its presence felt.,1110
Tank Girl,"Add an Iggy Pop cameo, an unconventional storytelling style, and a unique stylized look, and you've got a comic-book movie unlike any that came out back then, nor much like the many that have followed in the more than two decades since its release.",1110
Double Happiness,"There’s undoubtedly bittersweetness to this portrait of a young woman fighting to be herself on every front, but that it's nevertheless such an irresistibly charming, never-flippant watch is a testament to [...] Mina Shum and Oh’s already mature talents.",1111
Double Happiness,"Mina Shum's debut film is consistently warm and amusing, although its energy flags a bit as the story unfolds.",1111
Double Happiness,"Compelling idea, but slow, boring execution.",1111
Double Happiness,Delightful Canadian film about one young woman's coming-of-age.,1111
Double Happiness,"When people say, ""Write what you know,"" they don't mean, ""Write about YOU YOU YOU!""",1111
Double Happiness,"Double Happiness is not a deep or brilliant film, but that's not its purpose. It establishes a chatty, confiding tone right at the top and follows through, like a long letter from a good friend.",1111
Cobb,Cobb is a refreshingly spiky antidote to all the Hollywood paeans to the glory of the game.,1112
Cobb,Most biopics mistakenly try to take us from cradle to grave and end up skimming the surface. The wisdom of Cobb is that writer-director Ron Shelton knows that the close study of a single day can decode a human life.,1112
Cobb,"A curiously gripping amalgam of Patton, Citizen Kane and Melvin and Howard.",1112
Cobb,To watch Tommy Lee Jones re-create the persona of the Hall of Famer in Cobb is to encounter the greatest SOB ever to come down the pike -- in or out of the domain of sports. The trek is hardly entertaining.,1112
Cobb,"While the story of Cobb himself is a worthy one (Shelton's treatment, believe it or not, even has its similarities to Orson Welles' Citizen Kane), Shelton shortchanges the very game that made the man famous.",1112
Cobb,"Unfortunately, the movie just makes Stump look like a self-important jerk, possibly a bigger jerk than Cobb, and Wuhl's affable, weightless performance doesn't help.",1112
Cobb,"Stump is well-played by affable Robert Wuhl, who has the unenviable responsibility of representing the one sane man in Ty's crazy universe.",1112
Cobb,"Cobb's accomplishments on the ball field would make for an absorbing documentary, but it's the passions and pitfalls of his private life that dominate Ron Shelton's melodramatic film.",1112
Cobb,"Cobb cuts right through the winner-take-all ethos of American athletics. It's a raw, inspired, audaciously funny, and unexpectedly moving collaboration between the writer-director Ron Shelton and Tommy Lee Jones.",1112
Cobb,"Ron Shelton, whose Bull Durham and White Men Can't Jump were jokey tales of disillusionment set in the sporting world, here redefines the life of an idol with a certain honest savagery.",1112
Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,"In its infinite wisdom, the Academy ignored Jennifer Jason Leigh’s towering work in this wistful movie about the Algonquin Round Table.",1113
Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,"Rudolph films with a bittersweet blend of epigrammatic flamboyance and tautly constraining elegance, a flowing visual style that captures the fun-loving, self-destructive strivings of great creators...",1113
Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,A highly absorbing but naggingly patchy look at the acerbic writer Dorothy Parker and her cohorts at the legendary Algonquin Round Table.,1113
Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,Absolutely superb.,1113
Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,"Rudolph's effort to dramatize the life of the acerbic writer is dissatisfying due to shallow script that offers only a sketchy look, and Jennfer Jason Leigh's stiff rendition further hampered by arch accent; it's all black-and-white style and no drama.",1113
Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,Only Alan Rudolph could make these people dull.,1113
Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,"""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle"" has its flaws, but it also has a heartfelt grasp of what set Dorothy Parker apart from her fellow revelers and makes her so emblematic a figure even today.",1113
Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,A great ensemble helps to cut through a fairly stuffy narrative.,1113
Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,Demonstrates how even highly gifted people can bring themselves down,1113
Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,"In its infinite wisdom, the Academy ignored Jennifer Jason Leigh’s towering work in this wistful movie about the Algonquin Round Table.",1113
Faithful,"I have all kinds of time for on-screen male pathology, but nothing about this movie is illuminating, plausible or funny; I emerged smoldering with ill-will.",1114
Faithful,"This film might not reinvigorate romantic comedies entirely, but it shows that new avenues within this genre can still be taken.",1114
Faithful,"A Faithful Man gives its audience pause for thought as it comes to its final moments and feels more substantial than its short running time, but its mixture of dark comedy and underlying drama manages to keep a steady balance.",1114
Faithful,[A] piquant chamber comedy.,1114
Faithful,A fresh and contemporary story about how feel love for others and for the self. [Full review in Spanish],1114
Faithful,Carrière's script succeeds as it finds truth in both life's heaviest moments and its most absurd.,1114
Faithful,Love is a battlefield in Garrel's delightful and ironic romantic comedy. [Full review in Spanish],1114

Faithful,A Faithful Man is made with heart. [Full Review in Spanish],1114
Faithful,"The film is about jealousy, all right, but also about the freedoms that each and every one of these characters have to do whatever they want, or that seems best according to their selfish convenience. [Full review in Spanish]",1114
Twelfth Night,"Even if you don't know the play, or don't ""speak Shakespeare,"" you're in for a lively, rewarding experience.",1115
Twelfth Night,Nunn's film succeeds beautifully in its chosen course.,1115
Twelfth Night,"Staring sardonically into the camera, Kingsley's cool fool gives this Victorian fantasy a modern edge, as a bitter commentator who dimly views romantic love as quite absurd.",1115
Twelfth Night,"I started watching the film by thinking, ""They should film more of the comedies,"" and probably They still should, but I ended by thinking, ""They really ought to hire movie directors to make movies.""",1115
Twelfth Night,Where is Preston Sturges when we need him?,1115
Twelfth Night,"A handsome, agreeably performed rendition that fails to ignite much laughter or any real emotion.",1115
Twelfth Night,Why Nunn chose to set this version in the 1890s is a little baffling.,1115
Twelfth Night,"The direction is assured, and the cast is masterly.",1115
Twelfth Night,"A comic meditation on desire, disguise and inherent bisexuality.",1115
Twelfth Night,Another fine film version of the Bard's work...,1115
"Mark of Zorro, The","This is a wonderful adaptation of the great romantic legend, based on the 1919 Johnston McCulley story.",1116
"Mark of Zorro, The","The romantic moments are unusually entertaining, largely thanks to the humor applied, turning some of the flirtation into comedy skits and others into hilarious notes on Diego’s effeminate facade.",1116
"Mark of Zorro, The",I still believe that ... this is a completely anachronistic film and that nobody can replace Douglas Fairbanks. [Full review in Spanish],1116
"Mark of Zorro, The","Tyrone Power is excellent as both fop and fox, and his swordfight with Basil Rathbone is just one of the many highlights in this exciting adventure yarn.",1116
"Mark of Zorro, The",It's one of the all-time great swashbucklers.,1116
"Mark of Zorro, The","If you really dig the newer Zorro exploits, there's very little reason to think you wouldn't enjoy a nostalgic trip back to the guy's earlier screen adventures.",1116
"Mark of Zorro, The",Maybe the cutest Zorro to come along until The Gay Blade.,1116
"Mark of Zorro, The","Powers can't match [Fairbanks'] astonishing acrobatics and doesn't try — but the rousing climactic duel against Basil Rathbone's villainous Captain Esteban, one of the best swordfights ever filmed at that time, almost makes up for it.",1116
"Mark of Zorro, The",Far and away the best Zorro ever!,1116
Surviving Picasso,Hopkins’ portrayal of [Picasso] is no less than brilliant.,1117
Surviving Picasso,"Surviving Picasso not only fails to entertain; it puts the artist and his work at considerable risk by playing into the hands of modern-art-haters, in this respect like the book on which it claims to be based.",1117
Surviving Picasso,...a stunning debut by Natascha McElhone...,1117
Surviving Picasso,"Ambition notwithstanding, Surviving Picasso fails prodigiously, mostly out of its own confusion over who it is about and what it wants to say.",1117
Surviving Picasso,Covers ten turbulent years in the life of this major luminary of 20th century art.,1117
Surviving Picasso,"When it is over we are left with the conclusion that if Picasso had not been a great artist, this story would not have much mattered; as a beast toward women, he was nothing special.",1117
Up in Smoke,Cheech Marin and Thomas Chong prove to be irresistible anti-establishment figures in this consistently amusing dum-dum comedy.,1118
Up in Smoke,"Classic stoner comedy has drugs, language, sex.",1118
Up in Smoke,"a shaggy slice of slacker comedy, and while no one will mistake it for a particularly well-made movie, it is imminently likeable and repeatedly watchable",1118
Up in Smoke,"The funniest of all the Cheech and Chong movies, Up in Smoke provides a feast of gags for the sympathetically minded.",1118
Up in Smoke,What's lacking in Up in Smoke is a cohesiveness in both humor and characterization.,1118
Up in Smoke,"Director Lou Adler (the record producer) finds a few chuckles, but mostly it's amateur night.",1118
Up in Smoke,"This Cheech and Chong weed comedy was dismissed by most critics (and parents) but it was embraced by young viewers and launched the subgenre of ""stoner"" comedies way before Linklater made Slacker.",1118
Up in Smoke,"As far as comedic ingredients go, weed is not so much a surefire laugh-getter as it is a free-floating lubricant capable of setting off wicked complications.",1118
Up in Smoke,Cheech & Chong had their act down pat by '78 and turned out to be a natural movie-comedy team.,1118
Up in Smoke,"As the most fun comes not from watching the movie but from recalling great lines later, it would seem that the audio success of C & C has not translated too well into visuals.",1118
Some Kind of Wonderful,John Hughes’ more fully-realized version of Pretty In Pink that truly gets the hopeless outsider’s view of romance without love and not gracefully understanding their pursuit of it.,1119
Some Kind of Wonderful,"It remains attentive to universal feelings concerning crushes and maturity, parenthood and personal responsibility, ultimately achieving just a bit more cohesiveness and liveliness than ""Pretty in Pink.""",1119
Some Kind of Wonderful,"Essentially a remake of Pretty in Pink but with John Hughes' preferred ending, Some Kind of Wonderful revisits the teen love triangle with some interesting notes but less energy.",1119
Some Kind of Wonderful,"It's pretty lousy, the weakest of Hughes' high school romps.",1119
Some Kind of Wonderful,"Stoltz makes an effective leading man, giving a touching performance in what is a genuinely charming film.",1119
Some Kind of Wonderful,Masterson and Stoltz possess talent and charm to spare. Here are actors making characters of what could have been cartoons.,1119
Some Kind of Wonderful,"''Some Kind of Wonderful'' is a slight and forgettable film, but Hughes still has an eye for young acting talent.",1119
Some Kind of Wonderful,"Hughes has absolutely nothing new to report--no fresh perspectives, no gratefully received maturity, nothing added or deepened. Or speeded up, from the feel of it.",1119
Some Kind of Wonderful,It is fairly predictable... but underneath that plot are 3 very well written and acted characters.,1119
Some Kind of Wonderful,That was what John Hughes did best. He used his characters to shatter every preconception teenagers have about those faces they see in the hall. He made icons out of outcasts.,1119
I'm Not Rappaport,Under Gardner's heavy-handed direction it doesn't transfer well from stage to screen.,1120

I'm Not Rappaport,The stuff of Hollywood? I don't think so.,1120
I'm Not Rappaport,"This is good stuff. Unfortunately, director Herb Gardner is a little too fond of writer Herb Gardner's script, which just keeps going and going and going -- until even two old pros such as Walter and Ossie have worn out their welcome.",1120
I'm Not Rappaport,"Two old guys, sitting on a bench, talking for two hours. That's my rewrite.",1120
I'm Not Rappaport,"The beauty of the language does come through, but the net effect of the movie is to make the viewers wish they had gone to the play instead.",1120

"Umbrellas of Cherbourg, The",The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is something rare nowadays: a film which gives the impression of having been made with joy.,1121
"Umbrellas of Cherbourg, The",Effortlessly romantic but also hauntingly bittersweet.,1121
"Umbrellas of Cherbourg, The","Though the scenario adopts the styling of a tragedy, the music stays consistently peppy, never quite giving in to the dramatic sincerity of the seemingly doomed couple.",1121
"Umbrellas of Cherbourg, The","The perfect collision of bold cinematic style, warmly-embraced melodrama, and emotional precision.",1121
"Umbrellas of Cherbourg, The",A sweeping love story about a young romance succumbing to the stark realities of life and the inevitability of growing up.,1121
"Umbrellas of Cherbourg, The","It has one of the best endings in all of cinema - if it doesn't break your heart, nothing will.",1121
"Umbrellas of Cherbourg, The","Charm may be in the eye of the beholder, but if you don't find this movie irresistible, you should get your eyesight checked.",1121
They Made Me a Criminal,"The strength of this picture lies, not so much in the story, as in the excellent performances.",1122
They Made Me a Criminal,"John Garfield has mode the grade, and Warner Brothers motion picture firm have themselves a brand new star.",1122
They Made Me a Criminal,"Made competently enough and solidly acted so that one might forgive all the plot holes, unconvincing romance and outdated cornball antics.",1122
They Made Me a Criminal,There's nothing in this material that calls for [Busby] Berkeley's particular talents.,1122
"Last Time I Saw Paris, The",The film struggles with its bathetic components.,1123
"Last Time I Saw Paris, The",I certainly wouldn't trouble you with a description of this abysmal film.,1123
"Last Time I Saw Paris, The",Somewhat engrossing but too much a dull and heavy-handed tragic melodrama.,1123
"Last Time I Saw Paris, The",This picture tries to please everybody. It won't.,1123
"Last Time I Saw Paris, The",An engrossing romantic drama that tells a good story with fine performances and an overall honesty of dramatic purpose.,1123
"Last Time I Saw Paris, The",F. Scott Fitzgerald's tragic love story was brought to the screen with surprising vitality under Brooks' expert hand.,1123
"Last Time I Saw Paris, The","Technicolor Parisian travelogue, MGM-style, that barely skims the Fitzgerald source material.",1123
"Last Time I Saw Paris, The",What is to be said of such a picture? The story is trite. The motivations are thin. The writing is glossy and pedestrian. The acting is pretty much forced.,1123
"Last Time I Saw Paris, The",An enjoyable (if heavy-handed) melodrama.,1123
"Farewell to Arms, A","So A Farewell to Arms has become a ""war movie."" But if, forgetting for a moment the comparison with the novel, we judge it from this point of view, our reservations give way to a certain admiration.",1124
"Farewell to Arms, A",This long and often boring tearjerker is a disappointing remake of a 1932 film based on Ernest Hemingway's novel.,1124
"Farewell to Arms, A",This attempt to make the audience feel what the lovers were feeling failed because even to the least experienced in love it was plainly an artificial and external alteration.,1124
"Farewell to Arms, A","What Hemingway wrote as an interlude of amorous flutes and distant drums, Producer David 0. Selznick has scored for brass.",1124
"Farewell to Arms, A",An overblown Hollywood extravaganza that was universally condemned when first released and hasn't improved with age.,1124
"Farewell to Arms, A","Perhaps what is most irritating about the film is that too many times an exciting scene of Hemingway's is shucked out in favor of a distressingly inferior one invented (if I may indulge the Muse a moment) by Ben Hecht, who is responsible for the script.",1124
"Farewell to Arms, A","Selznick's last film as producer is a vastly disappointing remake of the superior 1932 version of Hemingway's novel, a sentimental, overblown production with stiff performances from Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones.",1124
"Farewell to Arms, A",Sweep and frankness alone don't make a great picture; and Farewell suffers from an overdose of both.,1124
"Farewell to Arms, A","This film, for all its size and color, doesn't do much more by Hemingway's book than was done by the sentimental version of it played by Helen Hayes and Gary Cooper some twenty-five years ago.",1124
"Farewell to Arms, A",A padded Ben Hecht script and Selznick's invariable tendency to overkill are equally to blame.,1124
"Innocents, The","For all its flaws, The Innocents still manages to be an intriguing and daring psychological horror, based around one very unnerving child indeed.",1125
"Innocents, The",It's really good.,1125
"Innocents, The",The young actors portraying these kids all deliver unexpectedly extraordinary performances. The group epitomizes a generation growing up utterly detached and subdivided.,1125
"Innocents, The","The second film by Norwegian director Eskil Vogt belongs to a fruitful narrative tradition of children capable of doing evil, even without being fully aware of it. [Full review in Spanish]",1125
"Innocents, The",The Innocents is a realistic and disturbing approximation to superheroes that explores themes such as friendship or loss of innocence. [Full review in Spanish],1125
"Innocents, The",... The screenplay slowly envelops the audience in the web woven by its protagonists. [Full review in Spanish],1125
"Innocents, The",Eskil Vogt creates a conducive atmosphere for this haunting thriller that disproportionately unleashes violent acts. [Full review in Spanish],1125
"Innocents, The","Each of the child actors performs remarkably well, but in the case of Sam Ashraf/Ben – that criminal mind in which defenselessness and evil pettiness nestle indistinguishably – the acting is superb. [Full review in Spanish]",1125
"Innocents, The",The Innocents has the particularity of being a thriller with supernatural elements. [Full review in Spanish],1125
"Innocents, The","Deeply uncomfortable viewing and as such is bound to elicit some strong opinions. For, despite the title and to quote a certain Queen of Pop, these kids are certainly “not that innocent”.",1125
"Old Man and the Sea, The",The emotional impact is second hand and the narrative seems unnecessarily padded.,1126
"Old Man and the Sea, The","A real curio, a thoughtful movie that entertains without ever really convincing.",1126
"Old Man and the Sea, The",There is as much raw excitement as you'd find at a bullfight or in a Hitchcock suspense movie.,1126
"Old Man and the Sea, The","Leland Hayward's massive production of Hemingway's short novel has been acclaimed in some critical quarters as a timeless masterwork, but 1 found it a disappointment and a bit of a bore...",1126
"Old Man and the Sea, The",The film can't do proper justice to the literary masterpiece.,1126
"Old Man and the Sea, The","The 1958 film, made six years after publication of the book, is a faithful adaptation - virtually a word-for-word copy of Hemingway's dialogue and prose - that is not without its faults.",1126
"Old Man and the Sea, The","Talky, but not surprising, since it is based on Hemingway story of old man (Tracy) musing about catching huge fish.",1126
"Old Man and the Sea, The",Tracy with a hokey accent floats in a studio tank for what seems like forever.,1126
"Old Man and the Sea, The",Tracy reading Hemingway's lines...brings to them a simple dignity and nobility that is hard to match.,1126
"Truman Show, The","It’s a curious social experiment idea, even if it's steeped in a fantasy so comprehensive that it always feels unconvincing.",1127

"Truman Show, The",Weir gave art-house slickness to screenwriter Andrew Niccol’s ponderous attack on television’s fraudulence and mass-audience cretins.,1127

"Truman Show, The",The Truman Show is a bold and inventive creation that holds itself as one of the defining films of its time.,1127
"Truman Show, The","The script by Andrew Niccol is endlessly inventive, and director Peter Weir finds just the right tone for the project.",1127
"Truman Show, The",The Truman Show might feel like it's from a different era but the film predates a cultural obsession with reality television while speaking to the dangers of surveillance in a satirical way.,1127
"Truman Show, The","... far more profound and elegant, examining the relationship between the observed and observer, between capital-driven entertainment and individual need.",1127
"Truman Show, The",There is a reason The Truman Show was nominated for multiple awards including three Oscars.,1127

Chungking Express,"Wong Kar-wai is one of the best filmmakers from one of the most significant film movements... And, in my opinion, Chungking Express is his best film. Supposing one plus one still equals two, that makes this one of the best films ever made",1129

Jupiter's Wife,Borderline disturbing but ultimately moving.,1130
Jupiter's Wife,"She may have a screw or two loose, but she's always engaging to listen to",1130
Jupiter's Wife,"The special appeal of ""Jupiter's Wife,"" which has brought its maker some film-festival prizes, is the way it allows its heroine to tell a profoundly sad story in her own high-spirited way.",1130
Safe,"Although occasionally exciting, there’s a pointed lack of gamesmanship in the events for a yarn involving spies, coupled with a lackluster quality that fails to leave an impression.",1131
Safe,"I had a great time with “Safe House”, and I don’t penalize it for aiming at a specific mark and hitting it.",1131
Safe,"Why do scripters even try to hide the identity of the villain until the end? Given the obviousness in these films, they might as well include a character named Professor Plum, usually found brandishing a lead pipe in the conservatory, and be done with it.",1131
Safe,"As for the action and choreographed violence, perhaps the number two reason for purchasing a ticket this weekend, again Safe House delivers adequately.",1131
Safe,"The South African location, Denzel Washington's duplicitous dialogue, and the intense car chases help to coax viewers into forgetting about the humdrum plot.",1131
Safe,"Nothing you haven't seen before, ""Safe House"" is lightning-fast, and full of shootouts, brutal fistfights, and chase scenes.",1131
Safe,"The end product resembles a Catherine wheel: a loud, bright firework that goes nowhere, spinning in circles until long after everyone stopped caring.",1131
Safe,"Probably so, it was fun and does what it does pretty well. Don't go in looking for a transcendent experience of film cause that's not what it is supposed to do.",1131
Safe,"Reynolds is the star of the film, but because he's the junior actor, playing the rookie character, he's given even less to work with. Racing from pillar to post, he just keeps his head down...",1131
Safe,"Plays it safe at every turn, and the result is a film that just can't compete with its own clear influences.",1131

Get on the Bus,A vital regeneration of a filmmaker's talent as well as a bracing and often very funny dramatization of urgent sociopolitical themes...,1134
Get on the Bus,"Bythewood's script offers sharp insights into the male psyche, and the fine actors play off one another with real assurance.",1134
Get on the Bus,"Though Lee's deft expertise keeps things pacy and (mostly) plausible, the material can't avoid a certain predictability and, in the end, a preachy sentimentality.",1134
Get on the Bus,"A stirring, heartfelt entertainment from the first frame to the last.",1134
Ghosts of Mississippi,"I've grown increasingly restive at such films as Mississippi Burning, A Time to Kill, and Ghosts of Mississippi... All three films celebrate the heroism of white law officers in prosecuting racist killers.",1136

Beautiful Thing,This is a very compelling film and a very timely one.,1137
Beautiful Thing,I thought it was extraordinary. It would be extraordinary even if it weren't timely.,1137
Beautiful Thing,"While it has the heart of a fairy tale it isn't really one: It's a dream realized, American folklore that is alive, because the Manley Crew Team never would've known what magic they could create with a boat until they were introduced to one...",1137
Beautiful Thing,[It] couldn't be more topical or inspirational in light of the current Black Lives Matter movement and calls for police accountability and reform.,1137

Best Men,"A low brow version of The Hangover and Bridesmaids, this crude comedy is filled with one-dimensional characters, a pretty lame set-up and humour that is only occasionally ridiculous enough to make you laugh rather than cower.",1138
Best Men,"Vulgar, trite comedy filled with drug use and sex.",1138
Best Men,"What really got on my nerves, more than the appallingly bad jokes and sight gags, is the terrible music that haunts the film from start to finish.",1138
Best Men,"From most vantage points, A Few Best Men seems like a real movie. It has a ""story,"" ""characters,"" & even scenes that superficially appear to contain ""jokes,"" but many sketches are ultimately just that; sketches that stop short of offering moments of wit.",1138
Best Men,An out-and-out failure.,1138
Best Men,A largely unfunny blend of frantic farce and gross-out humour.,1138
Best Men,This Australian Hangover-style ensemble comedy strains so hard to be funny that it barely raises a smile,1138
Best Men,"When it eventually does let loose and go for some big gross out laughs - like feeding a sheep laxatives - it starts to work, but it's too little too late.",1138
Best Men,"When embarrassment fails to be funny, it ends up as truly excruciating, and such is the case here.",1138
Best Men,This stomach-churningly dreadful film proves that our friends in the Southern Hemisphere can scrape corners of the barrel inaccessible to even the most fetid American imaginations.,1138
Hackers,"It's not a picture for cynics, requiring some relaxation while Softley explores old tech and cartoon personalities, but it's a vibrant feature that's superbly executed, making for an entertaining sit for those willing to go along with it.",1139
Hackers,Cutting-edge ideas can’t quite compensate for a banal storyline.,1139
Hackers,"When you look beyond all the visuals, it's pretty dull.",1139
Hackers,"One may criticise Hackers for being unreal, ridiculous or just too cheesy, but it stands as one of the most underrated gems to have come out of the 1990s. The performances are vibrant, the storytelling is kinetic and the visuals are something to behold.",1139
Hackers,Rarely do movies try-and fail-as hard to be cool as Hackers.,1139

Hackers,"After the mechanics of the thriller plot start to kick in, the film drags. And when it's time for the big cyber-showdown, we're stuck, once again, with footage of frantic typing.",1139
"Road to Wellville, The","All is, obviously, not well in Wellville. If you manage to sit through the entire two hours of this smelly movie, you'll need two weeks at a spa.",1140
"Road to Wellville, The",Painful.,1140
"Road to Wellville, The",Much maligned Alan Parker comedy that looks better all the time,1140
"Road to Wellville, The",Even a stellar cast can't save this meandering farce from a script that needs a high colonic.,1140

"Road to Wellville, The",One hilarious organic metaphor after another,1140
"Road to Wellville, The","Off-putting at first, this self-consciously scatological comedy does grow on one.",1140

"War Room, The","The War Room is about the day-to-day grunt work of politicking, in rooms filled with fluorescent lighting and bad coffee and ragged adrenaline energy.",1141
"War Room, The",The film offers an inside look at a campaign through the eyes of those who lived it with the intimacy that we've come to expect from our campaign documentaries.,1141
"War Room, The","An eye-opening journey into the lost art of politicking, The War Room is a must-watch for anyone curious about the nuts and bolts of campaigning for office.",1141
"War Room, The",It's a testament to the supreme skills of Hegedus and Pennebaker that they managed to craft a film that so easily could have gone astray.,1141
"War Room, The","It's so intoxicating that sometimes it's easy forget we are, in effect, watching a couple of pitch men selling that year's newest brand of soap.",1141
"War Room, The",Illustrates in often amusing detail how the Clinton team managed to overcome petty hostilities and seize the day -- and the White House.,1141

"War Room, The",An invaluable record of Bill Clinton's unlikely rise to the White House.,1141

When We Were Kings,"Gast does a nice job of building the suspense leading up to the fight, fleshing out the story with some good color commentary...",1142
When We Were Kings,"When We Were Kings as not just one of the greatest sports documentaries of all time, but also one of the greatest concert movies.",1142
When We Were Kings,"At the time, it was a given that Foreman was going to slaughter Ali in the ring; the beauty of this movie is that it shows in amazing detail the process through which Ali stepped up to the challenge and succeeded against all expectations.",1142
When We Were Kings,"Both a tribute to Ali and an evocation of a bygone era, it's about the transformative moment when black America, flexing its newborn pride, encountered black Africa.",1142

When We Were Kings,A film that answers why Ali's death is so significant. [Full review in Spanish],1142
When We Were Kings,"Almost too concentrated on Ali, but the story plays well with an exhilarating pace and plenty of well-remembered expositional details.",1142
When We Were Kings,Gast never makes a mistake by turning the camera on Ali-he comes through like a champ,1142
When We Were Kings,"If anyone deserves an award, it is Ali; his charisma makes the film.",1142

Hard Eight,"So, is Hard Eight as good as Magnolia, There Will Be Blood, Phantom Thread, or Boogie Nights? Absolutely not. But for many other directors, this would be a fantastic film to hang your hat on.",1143
Hard Eight,P.T. Anderson’s self-assured filmmaking belies the fact Hard Eight was his very first feature.,1143
Hard Eight,"A solid and unpredictable debut from Paul Thomas Anderson (whose preferred title for the film is ""Sydney"").",1143
Hard Eight,Showed a young filmmaker still finding his voice but showing much potential. (25th anniversary),1143
Hard Eight,"We come to understand that Sydney is a living loose end, a vessel for his own regret, a man incapable of resolving the conflicts he's created.",1143
Hard Eight,Hall is sensational; he's naturally levelheaded and entirely believable as the unflappable father figure.,1143
Hard Eight,I didn't like it. The whole thing seemed kind of smug to me,1143
Hard Eight,Just a soupcon of livelier drama would have improved the proceedings considerably.,1143
Hard Eight,"This first feature by writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson is impressive for its lean and unblemished storytelling, but even more so for its performances.",1143
Hard Eight,"The film doesn't rush, it's not self-absorbed in the Tarantino fashion, it just clicks along relentlessly, picking up power, particularly as threats develop to Sid's well-ordered view of the world.",1143
"Quiet Room, The",The Quiet Room was a little too quiet for me.,1144
"Quiet Room, The",A profound film about the emotional intelligence of little children and the holy calling of parenthood.,1144
"Quiet Room, The","An exceptional, if not perfect, Australian drama that gets farther into the inner workings of a child's mind than any other film I've ever seen.",1144
Blue Chips,"Friedkin and Shelton know how to mix action, words and music effectively, and Nolte absolutely gives until it's gone as Pete Bell, who will make basketball seem exciting and sexy even to a casual fan.",1145
Blue Chips,"While shot dynamically, the camera movements and editing diminish the on-court action.",1145
Blue Chips,"Features an absolutely terrific performance by Nick Nolte, and provides evidence that William Friedkin's abilities as a director could make movies that were compelling, lively, exciting, and thoroughly entertaining, no matter their subject matter.",1145
Blue Chips,"Watching various hoop stars and legends trying to act is cringeworthy, O'Neal particularly bad, but Friedkin's movie, written by sports film specialist Shelton has a lot of passion.",1145
Blue Chips,A good concept fails to become a good movie in this predictable tale of corruption in college basketball.,1145
Blue Chips,A deafness-inducing but otherwise ho-hum would-be expose of shady recruiting practices by college basketball programs.,1145
Blue Chips,Not even an unsentimental basketball fan like director William Friedkin can wash away all the corn syrup.,1145
Blue Chips,This hard-hitting college basketball drama marks a notable return to form for William Friedkin.,1145
Blue Chips,"[An] effective, if overlong basketball drama.",1145
Blue Chips,"If Mr. Friedkin didn't have to work so strenuously framing two-shots of Mr. Nolte with this seven-foot athlete, it might be hard to remember that Mr. O'Neal has a day job.",1145
Calendar Girl,"Sweet and airy and pleasantly nostalgic, Jason Priestley's first starring vehicle is cotton-candy entertainment for summer's end.",1146
Calendar Girl,"As such, it's a cute picture; if you were looking for the ideal word to describe Calendar Girl, it might be watchable.",1146
Calendar Girl,A hackneyed period comedy.,1146
Calendar Girl,Can't we just agree to let Marilyn Monroe rest in peace?,1146
Calendar Girl,"In this meant-to-be-charming saga of youthful adventure set in 1962, Priestley is the dead weight.",1146
Calendar Girl,"On film, the story's charm fades fast.",1146
Calendar Girl,"The film revives the voyeuristic smarminess of early-'80s spring-break comedies, only now it's passed off as soulful nostalgia.",1146
Calendar Girl,"Masquerading as a wild romantic adventure, Calendar Girl is actually a dull, sanctimonious morality tale about the meaning of friendship and manhood in the manner of James Dean's melodramas.",1146
Calendar Girl,"Poor teen period piece. Not enough Marilyn Monroe, and a god-awful chase subplot.",1146
Calendar Girl,You've seen it all before.,1146
My Family,New and old school fans will definitely love the aspects of pro wrestling and get a glimpse of the journey that Paige went through.,1147
My Family,...packs far more heart and more character depth than I was expecting.,1147
My Family,"When it’s all said and done, Fighting with My Family‘s bush league to professional yarn is a crowd-pleasing good time with a lot of heart.",1147
My Family,"Fighting with My Family gives us a story with enough heart and laughs that is sure to win over audiences and maybe, just maybe, create a few new wrestling fans in the process.",1147
My Family,Episode 31: Fighting with My Family / Happy Death Day 2U / Greta,1147
My Family,"Fighting with My Family is a fun and surprising emotional story about a quirky, ambitious clan. Wrestling fans may be most drawn to it, but it still has a lot to offer even if you've never watched a match in your life.",1147
My Family,"This movie is definitely funny, but it also has an emotional heft I didn't expect.",1147
My Family,"It is a universal story about outcasts who create community through sport and heart combined with the kind of ""soap opera in spandex"" storytelling that has made wrestling so popular.",1147
My Family,"It is thanks to Merchant that the film achieves what it sets out to do ... His characters, though based on real people, pop off the screen and take on a life of their own. They may just make a wrestling fan out of you by the end of it.",1147
My Family,"Energetic, rousing, and routinely hilarious - quite the feat for what is, superficially, just a wrestling biopic.",1147
Tom & Viv,"How good Miss Harris is at portraying one of those English, upper-class, protected women (she was wonderful in the same sort of part on Broadway in An Inspector Calls).",1148
Tom & Viv,"An amount of telescoping is inevitable in a story which spans 32 years, but you are left with the feeling that the film has cunningly leapfrogged over key events you would have liked to see.",1148
Tom & Viv,"Miranda Richardson gives a distinguished, Oscar-nominated performance as poet T.S. Eliot's first, troubled wife in this disappointing and superficial biopic.",1148
Tom & Viv,"An uninvolving, pretentious bore.",1148
Walkabout,Roeg successfully conjures up a tale that is as dazzling as the shimmering landscape against which it is set.,1149
Walkabout,"One of cinema’s great mood pieces, a complex, multilayered work that relies as much on its visuals and sound schemes as on plot and characterization.",1149
Walkabout,"Somehow both timeless and yet distinctly a film that could only have been made in its time, Walkabout captures strange, captivating beauty and the memory of a world gone by, reassembled for our viewing pleasure.",1149
Walkabout,"The cinematography is stunning, as one would expect given Roeg’s background, and conveys the vastness of the landscape even as the drama remains small and intimate.",1149
Walkabout,"…Walkabout is still a unique film that pulls together the nihilism of Zabriskie Point and Easy Rider, and then fashions an atavistic adventure that was somehow throught to be perfect fodder for British kids…",1149
Walkabout,...seems to take place somewhere between a pleasant dream and a nightmare.,1149
Walkabout,"There is always this feeling that Roeg, the cameraman for Fahrenheit 451 and Far from the Madding Crowd has a positive and original talent bursting to be developed. It's just a case of what that talent is going to find to say.",1149
Walkabout,Roeg's training as a cinematographer brings both advantages and hazards.,1149
Walkabout,"The film is rich enough, especially at a second look, to make you forget the flaws. You are left with the impression of a fresh, powerful and humane imagination.",1149
Walkabout,"What makes the film triumph over this literalness is another kind of intensity which one feels, since it's a filmmaker's, is all Roeg's.",1149
Last Dance,"The Venom series can’t think in more imaginative terms than strategic deployment: Maybe if Hardy goes for it even harder, the greater Marvel universe will have no choice but to bend back in our direction!",1150
Last Dance,"The Venom series began as a lazy, cynical IP cash-in born from the wrongheaded notion that moviegoers want cinematic universes and superheroes in the abstract. It is now oddly innocent and specific, even compared to the brand it tried to emulate.",1150
Last Dance,"As far as road trip tales go, “Venom: The Last Dance” finds a steady route.",1150
Last Dance,"Playing Eddie and Venom, Tom Hardy wrings a surprising amount of sentiment from a performance that essentially involves talking to himself, and the film derives its tender tone from the notion that this partnership might finally have to come to an end.",1150
Last Dance,"An absolute car crash of a film. That's not to say that bits of it aren't entertaining... if you throw enough poop at the wall, then some of it it's gonna stick.",1150
Last Dance,"Marcel does understand that humour is the key to engaging with this character, the ""buddy comedy"" interplay between Eddie and Venom, and she gives the film a light touch with plenty of charming moments.",1150
Last Dance,So it's entirely possible that this movie felt like a letdown because the first two were decent and Tom Hardy is delightful but everybody involved just ran out of steam and gave up and decided to bum everybody out.,1150
Last Dance,"The tired dynamic between Eddie and Venom, underdeveloped new characters, and a weak central antagonist make Venom: The Last Dance the most uninspired entry in the series.",1150
Last Dance,"If this is truly the last we’ll see of this iteration of Venom, then good riddance.",1150
Last Dance,"“Venom: The Last Dance” is like a graveyard for good actors’ spirits to die. Hardy, who is one of the greats, is just phoning it in and looks as if he is in this film under great duress.",1150
Original Gangstas,"It's good to see the stars from those 70’s “black exploitation” blockbusters working again, even if it is naïve to believe they can come back 20 years later and wipe out today’s dope dealers.",1151
Original Gangstas,"This is solid action fare with saggy bits, but there's enough ass-kicking, Molotov cocktail-throwing and gunfire to keep their erstwhile fans amused, and the screenplay cleverly knits the old traditions of Shaft together with Boyz 'n' the Hood.",1151
Original Gangstas,"Although the leads are intended to be cool and menacing, the result resembles parody; scenes of drugs, guns and fights are likely to make audiences burst out in laughter.",1151
Original Gangstas,"Original Gangstas leaves you feeling that more could have been made of this 'blaxploitation' reunion, but it's not bad -- and no more and no less substantial than the films of the original cycle.",1151
Original Gangstas,Think Boyz N the Hood meets The Mod Squad.,1151
Original Gangstas,Where Original Gangstas works is in its understanding that the stars are playing the characters they created 25 years ago as their older selves.,1151
Original Gangstas,"Despite its good intentions, Original Gangstas isn't very good.",1151
Original Gangstas,"The purpose is to entertain, and on that score the film delivers impressively.",1151
In Love and War,All’s poor in In Love and War.,1152
In Love and War,"I will cherish my memory of Chris at the end of ""In Love and War,"" bearded and bitter, drinking fiercely and trying very hard to be dark and tormented.",1152
In Love and War,Boring and artificial,1152
In Love and War,"Before you can say 'gangrene,' the two fall for each other, but everyone knows that historical romances released in December are never destined to end happily.",1152
In Love and War,"The movie, based on the book Hemingway in Love and War, moves at a lanquid pace that never stirs the emotions.",1152
In Love and War,Cautionary tale about the dangers of romantic infatutation.,1152
In Love and War,Not as bad as you'd expect. Good for a rainy day.,1152
In Love and War,Can a film be saved by its music?,1152
In Love and War,All’s poor in In Love and War.,1152
In Love and War,"I will cherish my memory of Chris at the end of ""In Love and War,"" bearded and bitter, drinking fiercely and trying very hard to be dark and tormented.",1152
Backbeat,"If there is a ‘most valuable player’ to this film it is Ian Hart, who blends an uncannily accurate voice with perfectly mimicked mannerisms and an impressive depth of character.",1153
Backbeat,The truth often undercuts the film’s simplistic notions about true love and about friendship.,1153
Backbeat,"When we have a comprehensive documentary available in the form of The Beatles Anthology, films like Backbeat end up serving as a moot point.",1153
Backbeat,Why would anyone would want to see a movie about the pre-fame Beatles when the post-fame Beatles had enough drama and excitement to fill several movies.,1153
Backbeat,"Despite some meandering moments, this remains a unique experience.",1153
Backbeat,"Get back, get back to where you once belonged, you want to shout. But the movie is stuck in the wrong groove.",1153
Backbeat,"It is the band, the group - with or without Sutcliffe - that makes Backbeat such a powerfully emotional elegy.",1153
Backbeat,"There's nothing very profound here, but we do at least get a nice handling of period and milieu, and pretty good performances of the songs.",1153
Backbeat,What pulls you over the bum spots is the electrifying immediacy.,1153
Backbeat,First-time director Iain Softley makes the film more visually distinctive than most music bios.,1153
Alphaville,Alphaville is Orwellian dystopia by way of Sam Spade sleuthing.,1154
Alphaville,"For all its influence, Alphaville still looks and feels like no other movie. More than a prophecy, it is poetry.",1154
Alphaville,A sci-fi noir maze...,1154
Alphaville,"Visually stunning, but ultimately peculiar, Alphaville isn't a sci-fi you've seen. The deliberate attempts to unease, and extend our curiosity in a stylish display make this darkly enticing film stand out.",1154
Alphaville,Take(s) elements of classic Hollywood and twist(s) them into a haunting foreshadowing of the Godard to come.,1154
Alphaville,"It really does feel like Godard has transported us to some other world, even if it's all a colossal put-on.",1154
Alphaville,"...Godard is having a bit of a laugh...and if everything in this film is just too much of whatever it is, that's totally deliberate on his part.",1154
Alphaville,"Godard whips this peculiar mélange of cinematic influences and invention into a work that is stimulating, stylish, and irresistible.",1154
Alphaville,"Always something strangely individualistic, utterly contemporary, and yet for all that, riddled with dj vu, cultural echo chambers, a kind of deliberately outmoded sleight-of-hand.",1154
Alphaville,"It's so archly intellectual that you fear it might splinter if you poke it in the ribs. It's also endlessly playful in its worship of American movie tropes, and deeply resourceful.",1154
Rendezvous in Paris,"Usher: Rendezvous in Paris delivers exactly what you think it should for a high-energy, sexually suggestive concert documentary of Usher performing in Paris. It's a competently made film but it has no surprises and isn't extraordinary.",1155
Cyclo,Part of Cyclo’s voluptuous mystery is that it unravels simultaneously like a documentary and an expressionist or surrealist vision.,1156
Cyclo,"Just as impressive as his feature debut Scent of the Green Papayas, as a poetic study of survival in modern and ravished Vietnam, Cyclo will be compared to De Sica's post- WWII classic Bicycle Thief.",1156
Cyclo,"Liquids become the motif d'abus of the film: water, blood, vomit, sweat, oil, urine, humidity, and paint.",1156
Cyclo,Features some eye-popping cinematography,1156
Cyclo,"La narrativa y la historia son perfectamente aplicables a la realidad social de nuestra ciudad, y la dinmica visual que presenta es digna de verse.",1156
Cyclo,"This powerful film offers Westerners a potent dosage of what life is like in a Third World country, a country most Americans only envision in a depersonalized way.",1156
"Relic, The","So it pains me to confess that, aside from the spectacularly ugly Kothoga (a creation of monster-making genius Stan Winston), the movie isn’t much good.",1157
"Relic, The",...a deeply silly and perfectly enjoyable no-brainer...,1157
"Relic, The","Features the best ingredients of contemporary monster movie formulas: loud noises, dark places, isolated characters, sudden images of bloody body parts, and red herrings.",1157
"Relic, The","In the end, The Relic erupts into a monster mash. Hyams has filmed it excitingly, and Stan Winston delivers a blazing special effect. But there is a bit too much of Godzilla in the monster when it finally is revealed in all of its ghastly glory.",1157
"Relic, The",A derivative and predictable post-Alien sci-fi horror film.,1157
"Relic, The","A surprisingly entertaining ""monster-on-the-loose"" picture set mostly in halls and private passageways of Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History.",1157
"Relic, The",No doubt the bill for Energizers alone took up a big chunk of this gory clunker's $48-million budget.,1157
"Relic, The","The story comes from a million other movies (mainly Jaws and Alien), and it's completely and totally predictable.",1157
"Relic, The","A slick, witty, and unexpectedly effective little genre throwback.",1157
"Relic, The","Though based on an original and respected novel, Hyams' horror thriller comes across as a pastiche of the genre's conventions as evident in major pictures of the past two decades, such as Jaws and the first two Alien films.",1157
"Fille seule, La",A fascinating revival of the French New Wave for a very 1990's slice-of-life film.,1158
"Fille seule, La",A Single Girl delivers 80 unbroken and ultimately irritating minutes in the life of a pretty hotel waitress (Virginie Ledoyen).,1158
"Fille seule, La","A stunning demonstration of moral and existential suspense in relation to duration, much like Agnes Varda's 1961 Cleo From 5 to 7.",1158
"Fille seule, La","Even though nothing much happens during the course of the movie (Valerie spends over half the running time wandering around the inside of a hotel), this is a thoroughly engrossing motion picture.",1158
"Fille seule, La","Benoit Jacquot's small, dazzling film A Single Girl is so buoyant, sharp-eyed and casually sexy it comes closer than any recent movie to capturing the essence of youth itself.",1158
"Fille seule, La",A hypnotic French import with next to no plot to interfere with its mesmerizing portrait of the moment to moment stuff of life.,1158
"Fille seule, La",Jacquot finds unexpected and intriguing drama in the daily routine of a contemporary young woman.,1158
"Fille seule, La","While A Single Girl ends without a sense of resolution, we do feel rewarded for having been in the presence of so lovely an actress as Ledoyen, from whom more is sure to be heard.",1158
"Fille seule, La","...if you were to fast-forward all the scenes where there is no talking, just walking, you'd be left with a very short movie.",1158
"Fille seule, La",We are led to believe that Valarie's experiences during this hour and all that quality meditative time she spends waiting for the elevator help her to reach her important decision. But it would be presumptuous to think we have learned anything about her.,1158
Stalker,"Impressive work. It challenges us, whether we are people of faith or not. In a dramatically fantastic artistic career, Stalker is Tarkobvky’s greatest achievement, and one of film’s greatest accomplishments, as well.",1159
Stalker,This is a film that sets itself apart from the rest for subtle reasons. It doesn’t jump out at you as something that is daring or audacious and you do have to dig a bit deeper in order to properly engage with it.,1159
Stalker,The opening is one of the most gripping and visionary moments I have ever seen in the cinema.,1159
Stalker,"No one tops Tarkovsky's ability for immersion, and the metaphysical enigma of Stalker is one of cinema's most impressive achievements.",1159
Stalker,There is no denying Tarkovsky's unwavering vision to create something so unique and transcendental. {Full review in Spanish],1159
Stalker,"The alternating use of matted and color palettes and frame within frame, shots by Tarkovsky and his trio of cinematographers, is an aesthetic wonderment in its own right.",1159
Stalker,Profoundly and fundamentally about the mood it creates and the atmosphere it evokes.,1159
Stalker,"Like something out of a dream, guiding us through a haunted, desolate landscape that eerily presages the Chernobyl disaster that would occur seven years later.",1159
Stalker,"It is masterfully done, contains some haunting images, and has a difficult-to-pinpoint mesmerism in the way it progresses. Once it gets you (which, for some, may never happen), it will hold you like a fly trapped in amber.",1159
Stalker,"It's a film that challenges us to be bored, while refusing to be boring.",1159
Love! Valour! Compassion!,McNally captures urban gay life in the final decade of the 20th century with wit and perspicacity.,1160
Love! Valour! Compassion!,"Terrence McNally's deeply human drama speaks with wisdom and humor about friendship, life, and loss.",1160

Hugo Pool,The bottom of the pool.,1175
Hugo Pool,Interesting -- but not riveting -- slice of life in Southern California.,1175

Young Guns II,"Full of sound, gunfire, fury and scorchingly beautiful landscapes, Young Guns 2 generates more sheer visual excitement than any Western since Peckinpah and Leone were in their last '70s prime.",1188
Young Guns II,"Young Guns II is a bad movie, too, but bad in an uninteresting way.",1188
Young Guns II,"As the movie goes on, a couple of the Regulators are gunned down, and all it really stirred in me was a wish that they not be reunited in that big valley in the sky for Young Guns III.",1188
Young Guns II,"Murphy directs cleanly, arranging the shoot-outs and Billy's personal declarations of doubt with a solid rhythm, making the film feel urged instead of assigned.",1188
Young Guns II,"Although it's more ambitious than most sequels, Young Guns II exhausts its most inspired moment during the opening credits and fades into a copy of its 1988 predecessor -- a slick, glossy MTV-style western.",1188
Young Guns II,Expected western sequel w/young Hollywood cast.,1188
Young Guns II,"The point is that the soundtrack includes Jon Bon Jovi, and that the stars play to the audience with a nod and a wink that says, 'Well, no one takes Westerns seriously any more, do they?'",1188
Young Guns II,Can you resist a movie with a Jon Bon Jovi theme song? You can? But this was before he turned into a total wuss!,1188
Prefontaine,The result is both too earnest and too campy.,1189
Prefontaine,"These shortcomings prevent Prefontaine from transcending the sports-bio genre, but it's still a vigorous, passionate piece of movie-making.",1189
Prefontaine,The most poignant aspect of Prefontaine has to do with the title character's adjustment to relative failure.,1189
Prefontaine,The story is not so much told as reported.,1189
Prefontaine,Prefontaine's cocky competitiveness overstrides his good qualities.,1189
Prefontaine,"Prefontaine is a fascinating hero, but his experiences become a string of sports-movie clichs in the hands of filmmaker Steve James.",1189
Prefontaine,"Behind decent performances by R. Lee Ermey and Jared Leto as Oregon running legend Steve Prefontaine, James manages to capture a feeling of reality that augments this tearful, yet stirring, tale of a great athlete who dies young.",1189
Prefontaine,"Unlike most sports movies, which have the artificial uplift of a pep rally, Prefontaine, small-scaled and quiet, is about defeat as much as victory.",1189
Prefontaine,"As Prefontaine, unknown actor Jared Leto does the best he can with a part that is sorely underwritten.",1189
Prefontaine,Steve Prefontaine must have been something special -- everyone says so -- but there's no magic on the screen.,1189
That Old Feeling,Surprisingly funny bickering couple movie.,1190
That Old Feeling,"What's in slow motion here is the progress of the plot. Every development is exhausting because we have arrived at it long, long before the characters.",1190
That Old Feeling,Reiner benefits from divine intervention from no less than Miss M herself. Bette Midler flings the usual zingers with fang-baring zeal in a part that plays to her brassy strengths.,1190

Before the Rain,"With incredibly well-crafted performances, a touching screenplay, and a larger thematic purpose; Before the Rain really does impress and absolutely deserves to be sought out.",1193
Before the Rain,"Brilliantly filmed by writer-director Milcho Manchevski in the rugged hills of Macedonia and the gray streets of London, this three-part tale proves a revelation, spellbindingly told and disturbingly contemporary.",1193
Before the Rain,"This is a formidable debut for Manchevski, who wrote the film as well as directed it... If all his films are as noble, beautiful and humane as his first, the American cinema will have a new master.",1193
Before the Rain,"In this triptych of inhumanity, Manchevski answers that, finally, man's humanity is as immutable as his violence. And that, finally, love is a given that keeps on giving.",1193
Before the Rain,"We'll have to wait for Manchevski's next feature to know whether he's an artist or a shrewd entertainer. In the meantime, Before the Rain is one of the more worthy efforts of the season.",1193
Before the Rain,"It shakes you up the way many other notable foreign-language film debuts once did -- films like""Breathless, The 400 Blows or Knife in the Water.",1193
Before the Rain,"The cast of international players is excellent, with Serbedzija delivering an especially fine performance as Aleksandar, a humanistic photographer.",1193
Before the Rain,"[This] eerily beautiful film constantly reminds us that there is an irresistible fascination, an absurd and terrible beauty, in the violence of our times.",1193
Before the Rain,"It has an unnerving feel, angrily observing the way meaningless violence can suddenly blossom and suck in innocents.",1193
Before the Rain,"Most of the characters are two-dimensional embodiments of commonplace attitudes, and few of the narrative developments gather much momentum.",1193
Once Were Warriors,"Lee Tamahori's feature film debut offers a cross-section of abuses, making it a searing portrait of self-destructive behaviors, toxic codependency, and gut-wrenching tragedy.",1194
Once Were Warriors,One of the finest films ever made on New Zealand soil has lost none of its raw emotional power and unbearable psychological intensity.,1194
Once Were Warriors,Once Were Warriors has more to say than the traditional TV-movie about spousal abuse. But some viewers will have to pay a price: This is a movie that requires strength and fortitude to sit through.,1194
Once Were Warriors,Once Were Warriors is a savage and dismaying tale of a venerable culture in decay and a film difficult to recommend.,1194
Once Were Warriors,"Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell, who plays Grace, had never acted before, and neither have a couple of the other key players. But under the careful direction of television veteran Lee Tamahori, they all do credible and forceful work.",1194
Once Were Warriors,"It's a fine, fierce and nearly unforgettable movie.",1194
Once Were Warriors,"A gritty, powerful first feature by Lee Tamahori.",1194
Once Were Warriors,"There's little new here, but uniformly powerful performances (especially Owen's) give the tale unexpected power and depth.",1194
Once Were Warriors,Tamahori's direction is consistently sharp and the film showcases two immensely powerful performances by Morrison and Owen.,1194
Once Were Warriors,"The howling raging energy of the prize-winning New Zealand film Once Were Warriors rushes at you, hits you like a smack in the face.",1194
Strawberry and Chocolate,"Truth be told, I sat there and chuckled warmly in all the right spots, and felt delight in the stubbornly stylish central character.",1195
Strawberry and Chocolate,"Its subject now reveals itself as political and social freedom in Castro's Cuba and this is what makes it an intelligent companion piece to Memories of Underdevelopment, Alea's earlier film.",1195
Strawberry and Chocolate,"A clear call for tolerance, deftly executed by a director for whom the personal and the political were indivisible.",1195
Strawberry and Chocolate,"It's a clear-eyed critique of the revolution's treatment of gay Cubans and, as such, it's a brave and important piece of film-making.",1195
Strawberry and Chocolate,"Watching his funny and likeable Havana-set comedy is like chancing upon some undiscovered early gem by Godard or Woody Allen, and yet it has a worldliness and drollery that is all its own.",1195
Strawberry and Chocolate,It's rather long-winded and the politics are pretty boring to an outsider.,1195
Strawberry and Chocolate,"A superb Cuban film from 1993, a little classic about gay freedom and its aspirations versus Fidel Castro and his Marxist straitjacketing.",1195
Strawberry and Chocolate,"It verges on the preachy, but it's a generous and intriguing film.",1195
Strawberry and Chocolate,Strawberry & Chocolate (Fresa y Chocolate) has a special place in cinema history.,1195
Strawberry and Chocolate,"The film's premise (friendship between a straight and gay man) may be familiar, but set in Cuba the tale's particular context adds freshness and political alertness, resulting in a charming film with a quasi-hopeful message",1195
Savage Nights,What seems most significant about the camera and editing styles is the way they play against one another.,1196
Savage Nights,The film has a degree of candour and integrity which is exceptional in an industry which ordinarily relies on teamwork.,1196
Savage Nights,"In his portrayal of a man sentenced to death but living life to the fullest, Collard has put together a compelling and original study of daring, dangerous, almost homicidal sexuality in these plague years.",1196
Savage Nights,"One of the first and most audacious films about AIDS, in which director Collard cast himself in the lead because French actors were reportedly concerned about playing a bisexual, HIV character.",1196
Savage Nights,"Bohringer makes the character real in countless details, and Laura's confusion and vulnerability undermine Collard's theme.",1196

Purple Noon,A decadent treat.,1198
Purple Noon,"This kind of thriller calls for finesse, perception and a knife-edged narrative drive. Plein soleil looks too often instead like an over-illustrated travel brochure.",1198
Purple Noon,There is some good stuff in the first half hour... [But] the film degenerates to cops and robbers.,1198
Purple Noon,"The tension is tantalisingly controlled, while the sight of the young Alain Delon languishing shirtless on a yacht provides a textbook definition of cool, and might be said to alone warrant the price of admission.",1198
Purple Noon,"Filmed in sumptuous colour, it's a deliciously amoral thriller with a devilishly attractive star.",1198
Purple Noon,"Its mechanical aesthetic suggests that rather than having to sublimate what remorse Tom Ripley might feel toward his actions, he simply doesn't experience any.",1198
Purple Noon,This expertly made film is utterly mesmerising. And its exploration of ruthless ambition is still fiercely timely.,1198
Purple Noon,Alain Delon excels as gentleman psychopath Tom Ripley in René Clément's beautifully restored classic.,1198
Purple Noon,"Delon is a terrifically good in the role: his almost unearthly perfection is creepy itself, as if he is imitating a human being.",1198
Purple Noon,"Highsmith had some doubts about the ending, which feels less daring than the one in her book, but there's a clever irony to it Hitchcock would have appreciated.",1198
Cemetery Man,Soavi's sophisticated shocker is a mordant delight.,1199
Cemetery Man,"If the film had been a hit, we might have gotten a series of increasingly less heartfelt, less handcrafted sequels--better one great film that stands alone.",1199
Cemetery Man,The film is an excellent entry point into the world of director Michele Soavi.,1199
Cemetery Man,A visually stunning horror comedy that is marred by a meandering and messy narrative.,1199
Cemetery Man,The visuals of this film is what is gonna sell you... it is goofy and cheesy and just all over the place.,1199
Cemetery Man,"While several moments are moderately scary simply because of shadows, eerie sounds, and building anticipation, humor is never too far away.",1199
Cemetery Man,"This over-rated film has developed an undeserved cult reputation, based on a handful of good elements; ufortunately, there is no plot, so all you need to see is the trailer or, at most, the first fifteen minutes.",1199
Cemetery Man,"""Cemetery Man"" (1994) is a quirky blend of romance, lust, surrealism, horror, and black comedy which transcends the work of better-known Italian horror maestros like Dario Argento thanks to its grotesquely humorous bent.",1199
Cemetery Man,"The film leans into modern comedy, but it also passes through moments of genuine longing and even existential crisis.",1199
Cemetery Man,...[peppered] with one incomprehensible sequence after another...,1199
Kim,"People are tuning in for the characters and to remember what they loved about the show or to introduce their kids to the show and on that front, Kim Possible delivers in a big way.",1200
Kim,I thought [Sadie Stanley] did a really good job playing Kim,1200
Kim,"Kim Possible raises the emotional stakes in exactly the smart, careful, fun way that only the best Disney Channel Original Movies can.",1200
Kim,"Though a few plot road bumps persist, Kim Possible manages a heartwarming ending, goofy and endearing characters, and a whole lotta wonderful corniness.",1200
Kim,Live-action cartoon update tackles tricky teen emotions.,1200
Kim,"It's all a good deal of fun, bringing the animated show to life while riffing on those conventions. That said, the tone can be a bit uneven.",1200
Kim,Sadie Stanley may be taking over for the title role in Kim Possible but the actress is certainly a star-in-the-making.,1200
"Maybe, Maybe Not","Some mildly funny jokes about the sexual confusions of that Seventies throwback, the men's group, lumber on into a fleshy farce that never entirely escapes the ponderous impress of Teutonic heaviness.",1202
"Maybe, Maybe Not",An entertaining gay comedy of errors from Germany who's main asset is the attractive Til Schweiger.,1202
"Maybe, Maybe Not","This movie, while not a comic masterpiece, is very funny in places, and unexpectedly affecting in other places.",1202
Top Hat,"Good-natured, warm-hearted and very witty, this is a movie to treasure for its sumptuous Art Deco design and the pairing of its principal players.",1203
Top Hat,"Astaire’s feline inverted-triangle face smiles atop a black swallow-tailed body undulating across the screen; he creates an exotic strangeness, juxtaposed with Ginger Rogers’s level-headed simplicity.",1203
Top Hat,"One of the cleverest of the musical comedies of the '30s, as well as, arguably, Astaire and Rogers' greatest collaboration.",1203
Top Hat,"Tops everything that Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have done, and clicks as the gladdest, smoothest, truestto-medium movie musical ever made.",1203
Top Hat,"In short, perfection.",1203
Top Hat,The dancing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers is one of the most agreeable sights of civilization. This has been said before - possibly in this column - but that isn't any good reason for not saying it again.,1203
Top Hat,"While personally I didn't think it was quite so swell as The Gay Divorcee or Roberta, it is still about ten times better than am musical that hasn't got Fred Astaire in it. The man is a maniac when he starts to dance.",1203
Top Hat,"Most of what I liked about Top Hat centers around its two stars: full of energy and grace, they breathe life into the film whenever it threatens to lose its luster.",1203
Top Hat,Arguably the classiest and funniest of the RKO Astaire-Rogers musicals.,1203
Top Hat,"If you want only one Astaire-Rogers musical, Top Hat is obligatory.",1203
To Be or Not to Be,"It took the mix of grace, sex, and slapstick energy that makes up the Lubitsch touch to create the funniest film ever made about the German invasion of Poland.",1204
To Be or Not to Be,"The running gags, swift direction, and concise script makes it the best comedy about Fascism since Chaplin's The Great Dictator.",1204
To Be or Not to Be,The film’s high purpose propels Lubitsch to unsurpassed extremes of inventive audacity.,1204
To Be or Not to Be,"It stars Jack Benny, one of the great Jewish-American comedians of the 20th century, and Carole Lombard, a wonderful screwball comedian, as well as Robert Stack and Sig Ruman.",1204
To Be or Not to Be,"Throughout To Be or Not to Be, Lubitsch orchestrates a comic work of art whose central theme of acting offers perhaps the most accurate assessment of and staggering blow against the Nazi movement ever put to film.",1204
To Be or Not to Be,"Slapstick switcheroos and distractions abound, but the underlying suspense of Nazi oppression never lets up.",1204
To Be or Not to Be,"Ernst Lubitsch's To Be Or Not to Be, starring Jack Benny and Carole Lombard, is a top-notch World War 2 satire taking place during the Holocaust.",1204
To Be or Not to Be,"To Be or Not to Be (1942) is Berlin Germany-born director Ernst Lubitsch's sophisticated screwball masterpiece, with satirical comedy, romance, and suspense. The controversial anti-war comedy about espionage and politics from producer Alexander Korda",1204
To Be or Not to Be,"Despite some of the serious situations, the comedic, brilliant, and delightful tone dominate in the movie, making it into a masterpiece. [Full Review in Spanish]",1204
To Be or Not to Be,"Although seemingly played for laughs, there is a depth and multilayered meaning to much of the action and dialogue that led an audience newly involved to consider what part they might play in a world at war.",1204
Amos & Andrew,"Frye proves a remarkably inept director, with little sense of pacing farce, or creating absurd characters.",1206
Amos & Andrew,Comedies about racism risk trivializing the issue on the one hand or becoming preachy and dull on the other. Amos & Andrew manages to do both.,1206
Amos & Andrew,A one-joke sketch that doesn't work as a feature.,1206
Amos & Andrew,"Cage is the only actor allowed to do riffs on his assigned part, something he takes full advantage of; the others are stuck with their two-dimensional satirical profiles, which grow increasingly tiresome and unyielding.",1206
Amos & Andrew,"A hhandicapped satirical farce whose roots are not in life but in other, better movies and sitcoms.",1206
Amos & Andrew,An ad for the unemployed actor,1206
Amos & Andrew,One of the stupidest and most morally retarded comedies of the decade.,1206
Amos & Andrew,"A very funny little film with big pleasures, and a most promising debut.",1206
Amos & Andrew,"If nothing else, at least the movie offers laughs without being offensive.",1206
Amos & Andrew,"Although the movie strives mightily to teach its lesson, which is that you cannot judge a man by the color of his skin, the humor is undermined by the sadness of the basic situation.",1206
Kiss of Death,"David Caruso did a solid job leading this film and going up against an unhinged Nic Cage. I definitely don't think Caruso deserved a ""Razzie"" nomination for this performance.",1208
Kiss of Death,I greatly enjoyed this crime thriller despite some heavy elements and moments. Nic Cage is insane per usual but the rest of the cast did a solid job as well.,1208
Kiss of Death,Both versions qualify as high-toned hackwork fitfully redeemed by a good story and some incidental pleasures involving the casting and camera work.,1208
Kiss of Death,Most effective are the authentic New York settings.,1208
Kiss of Death,"Unfortunately, Barbet Schroeder's Kiss of Death is not just bad; it's confusing.",1208
Kiss of Death,There's little doubt that Kiss of Death fares best in its opening stretch...,1208
Kiss of Death,What's most effective about the new Kiss of Death is Tucci's marvelously slimy prosecutor.,1208
Kiss of Death,"Classy film noir, as you would expect from a team including director Barbet Schroeder, writer Richard Price, and Nicolas Cage...",1208
Kiss of Death,A crackling thriller that feels unusually attuned to its lowlife characters.,1208
Kiss of Death,"Gutsy dialogue, atmospheric direction, lots of night scenes and an uninhibited take on the source material.",1208
Mixed Nuts,"Honestly, there's very little there that's likely to appeal to kids anyway -- except maybe an early appearance by Adam Sandler being Adam Sandler.",1209
Mixed Nuts,"...success is due almost entirely to the engaging, charismatic efforts of its various performers...",1209
Mixed Nuts,Even fans of Nora Ephron knew well enough to stay home and roast chestnuts on an open fire instead.,1209
Mixed Nuts,"Even for a Christmas comedy, it's blasphemous -- delightfully so.",1209
Mixed Nuts,"Director/co-scripter Nora Ephron pitches the humor at a cacophonous level and displays the comedic equivalent of two left feet in evolving an absurdist, slapstick yarn.",1209
Mixed Nuts,"A relentlessly hectic, poorly structured farce that falls embarrassingly flat.",1209
Mixed Nuts,The beginning of Steve Martin's non-funny comedies. Ephron should know better as well.,1209
Mixed Nuts,Martin's comedic talents show no signs of life in this truly abysmal adaptation of a superior French farce...,1209
Mixed Nuts,"Ephron's timing and sensitivity have deserted her, leaving behind only the sentimentality.",1209
Mixed Nuts,"A dreadful, dreary would-be dark comedy.",1209
Virtuosity,...mostly watchable yet thoroughly erratic...,1210
Virtuosity,Russell Crowe is the only reason to watch.,1210
Virtuosity,"Someone should have told Washington. He plays the hero in such a stiff, above-it-all manner that you get the idea he can't wait to pick up his paycheck.",1210
Virtuosity,"Although the climax tries to fix it, Virtuosity is as soulless as the direction of Leonard during the entire duration of the film, and the performance of Kelly Lynch is not credible as a fierce criminalist psychologist. [Full Review in Spanish].",1210
Virtuosity,"Shallow stuff, but the solid visual effects, decent stunts, and the work of Washington and Crowe make it watchable.",1210
Virtuosity,The worst movie that could possibly be made starring Crowe and Washington,1210
Virtuosity,The presence of Washington lends the picture a much-needed dose of authenticity. But in the end Virtuosity is disconnected and uninvolving.,1210
Virtuosity,"Despite the fact that it treads recycled waters, Leonard's film is an enjoyable ride.",1210
Virtuosity,...mostly watchable yet thoroughly erratic...,1210
Virtuosity,Russell Crowe is the only reason to watch.,1210
Blue Sky,"When it sticks to the family and to Lange's showy and fierce performance, it is something to watch.",1211
Blue Sky,"Indeed, it is Lange's performance that still holds this film together... Presented as a ferocious feline, Lange excels here at the small tics hinting at the madness always lurking below the surface.",1211
Blue Sky,"Blue Sky amounts to a potent audition for [Lange] role as Tennessee Williams' mad, delicate Southern gentlewoman.",1211
Blue Sky,The final film by the great Brit director Tony Richardson.,1211
Blue Sky,"The melodrama can be forgiven. What lingers in the mind is Richardson's hard-won, grown-up humanism.",1211
Blue Sky,Watching Lange and Jones together is like being caught in sheet lightning.,1211
Blue Sky,Jones and Lange at their best.,1211
Blue Sky,Persuasively alive... The movie is sufficiently at odds with itself to be both frustrating and intriguing.,1211
Blue Sky,There are two reasons to see this preposterously plotted military-marital melodrama: Jessica Lange's Oscar-winning performance and the fact that it became Brit Tony Richrdson's very last work.,1211
Blue Sky,Lange and Jones are an electrifying couple,1211
Flesh and Bone,…catches some top talents at various stages in their careers… something of a treat for fans of good acting…,1212
Flesh and Bone,"Four great characters. Four strong turns. The film takes them exactly where you expect, to a mildly meandering detriment. Still, there's authenticity about this slice of America & a staunch swerve away from the sentimental feeling that love conquers all.",1212
Flesh and Bone,"Although the plot comes to rely on a particularly outlandish series of coincidences, it's a credit to Kloves's skill that you can almost put this out of your mind...",1212
Flesh and Bone,"Quaid's solid performance holds the film's loose ends together. He's really very much at home on the range here...Ryan rises pretty much above her more usual perky, pretty image, giving a funky performance.",1212
Flesh and Bone,"A downbeat, elegiac mood piece and character study about angry, damaged people whose lives are as desolate as the dusty West Texas landscape they inhabit.",1212
Flesh and Bone,"A nice, heavy movie, if a bit depressing.",1212
Flesh and Bone,"Haunting film, with unexpectedly great supporting performances by Caan and Paltrow",1212
Flesh and Bone,A captivating thriller with three solid performances,1212
Flesh and Bone,"The film starts better than you've heard, but soon gets worse than you predicted.",1212
Flesh and Bone,Explores the searing power of evil.,1212
Guilty as Sin,"It is an intriguing pictorial concept, but one that confers a bland, glassy look, rather than a dizzying effect, on Guilty as Sin.",1213
Guilty as Sin,It sure looks like a TV movie.,1213
Guilty as Sin,"One of the good ""yuppies-in-jeopardy"" thrillers that were so prevalent in the early 1990s.",1213
Guilty as Sin,Don Johnson proves he stinks as a movie star.,1213
Guilty as Sin,"Johnson's sort of good, surprisingly, but this is just expensive trash.",1213
Guilty as Sin,Almost succeeds as a high-camp hoot ... but not quite.,1213
Guilty as Sin,"The plot is preposterous, the logic is sometimes faulty, but Lumet and his actors don't step wrong in the central thrust of the story.",1213
Guilty as Sin,"Probably worth seeing on a slow night, but only if you want to keep things that way.",1213
In the Realm of the Senses,Oshima transgresses on the forbidden nature of sexuality as a private and personal experience. In the Realm of the Senses acts consciously to break down taboos to liberate the audience from their own obsessions.,1214
In the Realm of the Senses,"As an erotic film, it climaxes in the demanding performances of Eiko Matsuda and Tatsuya Fuji, but I suspect that its marathon exercise in obsessive sexual pleasure remains on a fatiguing and thinly dull surface. [Full review in Spanish]",1214
In the Realm of the Senses,"Serenity in intensity, bliss in turmoil, transcendence in total perdition, that, with very modest means, is precisely what Nagisa Oshima has achieved in his very latest film, In the Realm of the Senses.",1214
In the Realm of the Senses,Time and space are suspended in [director Nagisa] Oshima's beautiful images.,1214
In the Realm of the Senses,"The cinematography, mise-en-scène, and music respond to the solid and unitary idea of the film. [Full Review in Spanish]",1214
In the Realm of the Senses,"In the Realm of the Senses remains one of the great erotic art films, and it retains 100% of its ability to shock and scandalize audiences today, every bit as it did in 1976.",1214
In the Realm of the Senses,It is the great example of Artistic Porno.,1214
In the Realm of the Senses,"This particular consideration of mutual possession which approaches and then transcends death is well-paced and, within story possibilities, -acted as well.",1214
In the Realm of the Senses,"That graphic sexual expression is the narrative currency Oshima uses to explicate a connection between sex and death only adds to the film's incalculable power to provoke, offend, frighten, and spellbind its audience.",1214
In the Realm of the Senses,"Oshima holds nothing back. Yet watching the couple's constant lovemaking is the very opposite of erotic. Which may very well be the point. Sada and Kichizo's fantasy world is strictly private; it doesn't just shut out society, it excludes the viewer too.",1214
Barb Wire,"Every time it tries to approach the subject matter with sincerity, it just grows more unintentionally goofy.",1215
Barb Wire,"A lemon of a comic book movie with an uninteresting heroine, bad acting, and a bland humorless premise...",1215
Barb Wire,...a consistently inept and astonishingly dull actioner...,1215
Barb Wire,"The irony of this style, with its high-swank grunge clutter, is that it's too dissociated to have coherence even as pop; we're always aware that we're watching sets being photographed.",1215
Barb Wire,"The movie carries its cyberpunk variation right through to the end, and usually with enough wit and craziness to freshen the mix. Then, there is Pamela, whose tight, disciplined performance deserves more respect than it will almost certainly get.",1215
Barb Wire,"Its main source is a comic book, but it might as well be a computer.",1215
Barb Wire,We used to complain about Hollywood travesties of great books; now we're reduced to kvetching about movies that cheapen the comic strips on which they're based.,1215
Barb Wire,"his cartoonlike starring vehicle for Pamela Anderson Lee offers enough choreographed fight sequences, heavy artillery and fleeting glimpses of the star's august body parts to satisfy the raging hormones of its target young male audience.",1215
Barb Wire,"The film's haphazardly edited, lacks narrative clout, and rambles on to a ludicrously extended conclusion.",1215
Barb Wire,There isn't a scene that Anderson-Lee walks through that didn't grab my attention.,1215
Kissed,"While the student/teacher romance never played sat well, Barrymore and Vartan have great chemistry (and it is *slightly* excusable as an adaptation of As You Like It). Otherwise this fish out of water film is totally rufus: sweet and charming.",1216
Kissed,...an oddly-paced and perpetually erratic endeavor that never becomes quite as easygoing as one might’ve anticipated...,1216
Kissed,"Attempts to tap into the sense of missed opportunity that one inevitably leaves high school with. Unfortunately, it fails to offer anything other than that same old crop of clichés.",1216
Kissed,"Never Been Kissed remains one of the best teen movies and romcoms of the '90s, and a true ode to nerdy, overly enthusiastic girls of all ages.",1216
Kissed,"""This is a very bad idea."" Exacta-mundo, sister.",1216
Kissed,Never Been Kissed does very little to distinguish itself from the umpteen other high-school comedies we've seen this year.,1216
Kissed,This is one of those films that just doesn't know when to end.,1216
Kissed,"[B]y and large she generates the kind of charm that, since Scream and Everyone Says I Love You, she's made her trademark.",1216
Kissed,"Too bad the film, about a budding journalist assigned to do an expose on the degradations of high school life, simply isn't worthy of [Barrymore].",1216
Kissed,"[T]hanks to Barrymore's captivating performance, a fun turn from David Arquette (as her slightly odd older brother) and a minor role for Leelee Sobieski, this is enjoyable fare.",1216
Assassins,Miike has delivered one of his very best films.,1217
Assassins,"""13 Assassins could end up being Miike's masterpiece. It's that good.""",1217
Assassins,It's clear that the exhilarating 50-minute climax battle is both the director's forte and his primary passion.,1217
Assassins,"Rather than being a simple action movie, it is all a bloody samurai film that revives the chambara genre. [Full review in Spanish]",1217
Assassins,...the film offers far more than cheap thrills and violent spectacle. 13 Assassins brings men to the crux of their beliefs and forces them to live out the reality of their choices in battle.,1217
Assassins,Takashi Miike has created a reverential and vital film in a genre that many may have thought as moribund and passé as its subject.,1217
Assassins,13 Assassins is a samurai movie dedicated to giving you what you expect in a samurai movie,1217

Assassins,"It's a reverent throwback to the great 1950s-'60s Japanese samurai films, and it's done in neutral shades of gray and white and tan and black.",1217
Friday,This film is a laugh a minute and portrays realistic characters each of us can relate to.,1218
Friday,"Director F. Gary Gray chooses to develop tension in this often over-the-top farce in a very unfunny, almost baffling way.",1218
Friday,"Crapping jokes and cussing jokes and look at that lady in her skimpy clothes jokes. I enjoyed this badly, stupidly, as it was meant to be enjoyed.",1218
Friday,"While the character-driven script has a weakness for toilet humor (Mel Brooks would be proud), its inhabitants are given some oddball quirks and tics that keep things percolating when the plot development runs a little thin.",1218

Friday,"Really funny, filmed great, with a lot of heart to it.",1218
Friday,I knew the picture was in trouble when its first gag involved an old lady spewing obscenities.,1218

"Goofy Movie, A",[A] gently amusing comedy that never quite figures out who its audience is.,1219

"Goofy Movie, A","Makes its title character the second banana to a protagonist and a scenario entirely unworthy of him, mired in instantly-dated sops to early-'90s pop culture.",1219
Higher Learning,"Director John Singleton turns his focus to prestigious universities, asking pointed questions about how these institutions perpetuate, or at least turn a blind eye to, important social issues.",1220
Higher Learning,"I felt like it was lengthy, and they could have chopped down some of this stuff while trying to appeal to everyone...Malik and Remy could have been the movie right there.",1220
Higher Learning,"What is high...what is learning...yes it's a pretty decent cast, but it's all over the place, and I really wanted it to end.",1220
Higher Learning,"It was too schematic, too didactic and too cliched to work.",1220
Higher Learning,"Cole Hauser is chillingly effective as the white supremacist skinhead who reveals Rapaport's potential for violence, while Jennifer Connelly gives the most adult performance as a worldly-wise lesbian.",1220
Higher Learning,"Good intentions, but dull and predictable.",1220
Higher Learning,Higher Learning sells its soul (and its brain) for overwrought melodrama.,1220
Higher Learning,"The film lapses into polarized melodrama but it's a handsome piece, displaying a fair understanding of our desperate need to belong.",1220
Higher Learning,"Singleton gets points for exposing the hypocrisy of ""politically correct"" institutions, but stilted dialogue and cardboard characterizations undermine the message.",1220
Higher Learning,"Despite some likable performances (Epps is especially winning), the drama in Higher Learning is constricted, hemmed in by Singleton's compulsion to view his characters as walking paradigms of racial and sexual politics.",1220
When a Man Loves a Woman,The double catharsis is very moving and the ending is immensely honest... [Full review in Spanish],1221
When a Man Loves a Woman,A most respectable drama with magnificent performances from the stellar protagonists that tries to go beyond average movies about addiction. [Full review in Spanish],1221
When a Man Loves a Woman,"Mandoki lets the weight of the movie fall on his two excellent leads, while he slips away assembling long scenes between them that work very well, but interspersed unnecessarily with musical and touristic intermissions. [Full review in Spanish]",1221
When a Man Loves a Woman,"It's an involving film which, for the most part, avoids preachiness. And it's entertaining in a way most movies care to be anymore.",1221
When a Man Loves a Woman,"Garcia, too, disappears brilliantly into his role, that of a well-meaning but inflexible man unable to cope with the transformations brought about by Ryan's attempts to sober up. [It's] a serious relationship study on par with the best of John Cassavetes.",1221
When a Man Loves a Woman,"Alcoholism has been called a disease of denial. What When a Man Loves a Woman understands is that those around the alcoholic often deny it, too, and grow accustomed to their relationship with a drunk.",1221
When a Man Loves a Woman,The performances of Ryan and Garcia and of the amazing 9-year-old Tina Majorino as daughter from an earlier marriage keep the story grounded in some semblance of reality.,1221
When a Man Loves a Woman,"Manipulative and weepy, When a Man Loves a Woman often feels like a grueling therapy session.",1221
When a Man Loves a Woman,"Garcia and Ryan make us believe and make us care, without the usual histrionics. When a Man Loves a Woman won't leave you shaken, but you'll probably be stirred.",1221
When a Man Loves a Woman,Andy Garcia conveys an almost glacial calm and fortitude beneath which a reservoir of boiling rage consistently seems to simmer.,1221
Judgment Night,"Aimed at teenage boys, this film offers a rather stylish ""as you were"" to those who already live deranged in a testosterone-induced reverie.",1222
Judgment Night,"The film was directed by Stephen Hopkins who directed PREDATOR 2 and BLOWN AWAY, so this film has ""irresistible 90s movie"" written all over it.",1222
Judgment Night,Short on both logic and suspense.,1222
Judgment Night,Judgment Night isn't so much the 90s classic you want it to be; but rather a nondescript footnote with killer tunes guiding you through.,1222
Judgment Night,"Hopkins displays a certain artistry, even in a film with little to say about anything, other than warning against unfamiliar detours.",1222
Judgment Night,Works as an absurd but entertaining action thriller...,1222
Judgment Night,"This is an exceedingly well directed, cleverly filmed and edited, tension-filled affair. It is also a wholly preposterous, muddled, paranoid view of the inner-city nightmare where the slightest misstep is sure to have a fateful result.",1222
Judgment Night,"Excellent soundtrack, appalling acting, especially by Gooding.",1222
Judgment Night,"A classy, edge of your seat thriller. Fun all round!",1222
Judgment Night,"A tight, energetic sleeper in the action-adventure genre, manages to pack a few anti-machismo sentiments into an otherwise brawny tale.",1222
King of the Hill,"Technically sound and sadly sugary in its handling of the truly devastating realities of the Depression, King of the Hill is not a bad film per se, just one that lacks a sense of consequence and a lasting impression.",1223
King of the Hill,"Despite Bradford's arresting lead performance, King of the Hill never comes alive: a childhood memoir frozen in amber.",1223
King of the Hill,"one of Soderbergh's best films: a painterly, thoughtful, and subtly emotional portrait of preadolescent coming of age in dire circumstances",1223
King of the Hill,"It all seemed like an oddly straightforward ... choice for Soderbergh at the time, but he has proven since then that his lateral range is almost immeasurable.",1223
King of the Hill,"King Of The Hill balances an incident-packed script with muted tones, painting a rich, absorbing picture of one boy's struggle to live by his wits.",1223
King of the Hill,To revisit King of the Hill—or to discover it—is to realize how seldom American cinema deems it worthwhile to tell a child's story with anything approaching serious psychological intent. [Criterion Blu-ray/DVD],1223
King of the Hill,Tenderly directed and written by Steven Soderbergh.,1223
King of the Hill,Early Soderbergh family drama is excellent.,1223
King of the Hill,"This dark, poetic movie is intended as a tribute to the resilient spirit of many Jewish families that had fallen on hard times; Aaron and his survival instincts recall the young protagonists of Mark Twain and Charles Dickens.",1223
King of the Hill,Bradford gives a memorable performance,1223
"Scout, The","At times, that more personal goal seems to eclipse the documentary’s informative objectives, but at the same time, these men’s pain and shame is the story of Scouting.",1224
"Scout, The",This is an incredibly well-made documentary and the subject matter is just devastating.,1224
"Scout, The","Sure the documentary leans a bit on the sensational side, but that can’t diminish the story at its heart: victims coming forward to speak about what happened to them and the voices of the people who are trying to get them some semblance of justice.",1224
"Scout, The","Many of the interviewees, all men except one, break into tears while talking to Knappenberger. Victims suggest that finally revealing what happened to them (and feeling not alone in it) is cathartic.",1224
"Scout, The","Scouts Honor: The Secret Files of the Boy Scouts of America is another film that will shatter your faith in institutions – particularly the conservative, faith-based ones – that claim to care for children.",1224
"Scout, The","It makes the common stylistic mistake of favouring scandal over sympathy, but even shortcomings such as this can’t get in the way of what is ultimately a stirring story of human bravery.",1224
"Scout, The","It adheres to the talking-head/archival-footage documentary template, its simple, straightforward style helping render it a rock-solid piece of journalism with an appropriately sober tone.",1224
"Scout, The","If you’re bursting with contentment by the end of Scouts Honor, you should be. There was an entire system in place for young boys to fall prey to nefarious men just on the merit of what the organization is “supposed” to embody.",1224
"Scout, The",[The] film is more lament than exposé: The tone is funereal; the tears are abundant. But the evidence that the organization knew that criminals were infiltrating its leadership is substantial and goes largely unchallenged.,1224
"Scout, The",It is the type of robust documentary filmmaking that moves beyond merely going back through what happened and delves into actively doing journalism — asking necessary questions of those who are somehow still shamelessly downplaying the crisis.,1224

Angus,"Even if you're long past the age of the characters in this film, you can enjoy the world of these girls who want, so badly, to become adults.",1225
Angus,"These are age-old themes, not tackled with particular verve here, but there's a nice moral about girls learning to accept themselves regardless of shape or colour.",1225
Angus,"Girls who are just starting to feel a little old for Hannah Montana will flock to this film, which will no doubt have a long life on the slumber party circuit.",1225
Angus,Chadha gets some bumpy performances from her teenage cast.,1225

"Awfully Big Adventure, An",A winning period picture.,1227
"Awfully Big Adventure, An","The filmmakers appear to be aiming for laughs much of the time, and on this level their efforts fall completely flat.",1227
"Awfully Big Adventure, An","The most startling thing here is Hugh Grant as a De Sade in luvvy's clothing. Grant embroiders him with impeccable details, while writer Charles Wood, adapting Beryl Bainbridge's novel, conveys the basics with admirable economy.",1227

"Awfully Big Adventure, An",Strange compelling film with strong performances,1227
"Awfully Big Adventure, An","Wow, is this depressing.",1227

Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,"There's still entertainment to be had as Seagal goes through his usual counterterrorism routines, but here he uses guns more than his famous hand-to-hand combat techniques.",1228

Ready to Wear,You can't satirize industries that are inherently self-satirizing.,1230
Ready to Wear,The spoof goes nowhere and takes a long time in doing so.,1230
Ready to Wear,"Ready to Wear is all appetizers: the main course never arrives. Still, the critical savagery puzzles me. Altman's movie may be indefensible, but it's not unenjoyable.",1230
Ready to Wear,Sporadically amusing camp mess.,1230
Ready to Wear,"Though it credits Mr. Altman and Barbara Shulgasser as writers, this film seems practically scriptless, to the point where much of it plays like a first rehearsal.",1230
Ready to Wear,Robert Altman may be the most inconsistent American film director alive.,1230
Ready to Wear,Altman's much-maligned comedy about the fashion industry deserves another look.,1230
Ready to Wear,"Despite some delicious moments, this sluggish, overlong, halfhearted satire feels like a movie that wanted to go somewhere but never got there.",1230
Ready to Wear,"Altman and his writer, former Chicago Sun-Times reporter Barbara Shulgasser, should have gone further and been meaner; too many of his jokes are generic slapstick, instead of being aimed squarely at industry's targets.",1230
Ready to Wear,It seems like a very long wait to get to the various punch lines.,1230
Marked for Death,Marked for Death is at its best when focused on the comings and goings of the take-no-prisoners protagonist...,1231

Madonna: Truth or Dare,"A very entertaining, and professional documentary. [Full review in Spanish]",1232
Madonna: Truth or Dare,Decadent good fun.,1232
Madonna: Truth or Dare,"The movie shows you exactly the image Madonna wants to put across, and no more.",1232
Madonna: Truth or Dare,"Truth or Dare, which comes on as if it were truth and dare, sets out to give us both the “real” offstage Madonna, shot in grainy black and white, and the performing Madonna during her “Blond Ambition” tour, shot in color.",1232
Madonna: Truth or Dare,The documentary doesn't ask you to empathize with how hard it is to be Madonna. It just asks that you experience how hard it is for her to not be Madonna and then tosses out any notion of hardship altogther by encouraging you to dance along.,1232
Madonna: Truth or Dare,"Quibbles aside, Truth or Dare delivers entertainment of mammoth proportions.",1232
Madonna: Truth or Dare,"Feeling at times carefully orchestrated, if you can accept this as part of Madonna's 'any publicity is good publicity' campaign, you'll be fine. And the concert footage is top value.",1232

Madonna: Truth or Dare,"You may not leave Truth or Dare loving Madonna, but you'll respect her as a force of nature.",1232
Madonna: Truth or Dare,Constant innovation and evolution is both Madonna's workaholic race against time and her relentless pursuit of the perfection she imbues upon her mother.,1232
Nénette et Boni,"With her final early-career film prior to her mega-breakout a couple of years later, Denis offers us a glimpse of her subversive and efficacious approach to gender and sexuality.",1233
Nénette et Boni,"French director Claire Denis has fashioned a quietly thrilling, unexpectedly poignant film with Nenette et Boni, a simple tale of a family reunion that earns its distinction in the telling.",1233
Nénette et Boni,"It's a melodramatic premise on paper that, in the wrong hands, might have succumbed to the sensationalism of its mildly incestuous undertones.",1233
Nénette et Boni,The films of French director Claire Denis often chart the flow of energy between two dissimilar people while contemplating their place within the larger community.,1233
Nénette et Boni,A sibling drama of unsentimental urban grit and swooning lyricism.,1233
Nénette et Boni,"Captures the fragile and fleeting impression you often have of life, that's actually closer to life itself than the more comforting, linear perspectives of narrative film.",1233
Nénette et Boni,... elliptical told drama that has mood trump over substance.,1233
Nénette et Boni,"Surely the least satisfying, least commanding work by its formidable director.",1233
Nénette et Boni,"[Claire Denis] feels affection for the characters, especially Boni, and is very familiar with them. Maybe that's why she feels free to tell the story so indirectly.",1233
Chairman of the Board,"Carrot Top doesn't stretch from his prop-heavy stage act. He mugs, pouts and speaks loudly. Luckily for him, Jack Plotnick's annoying portrayal of Zak saves him from being the movie's worst actor.",1234
"Other Voices, Other Rooms","What good is imagination, if you don't have the guts to live it? By the end of ""Other Voices, Other Rooms,"" a moody piece of cinema based on a novel Truman Capote wrote 50 years ago, our protagonist has answered his own question.",1236
"Other Voices, Other Rooms","The strength in Other Voices, Other Rooms is above all stylistic and atmospheric...",1236
"Other Voices, Other Rooms","It was a risky choice of source material for a first feature for documentarian David Rocksavage, and this isn't a particularly distinguished debut.",1236
"Other Voices, Other Rooms","Literal to a fault, enervatingly paced, and lacking the novel's poetic vitality, the movie seems stilted and stultifying.",1236
Twisted,I immensely enjoyed it as a psychologically pulsating underrated film noir.,1237
Twisted,It's sad to see the director of The Right Stuff and The Unbearable Lightness of Being reduced to this.,1237
Twisted,"Numbingly predictable, inept, and boring.",1237
Twisted,At least the performances are solid.,1237
Twisted,"Judd, Samuel L. Jackson, Andy Garcia and David Strathairn all are wasted.",1237
Twisted,This thriller seems most interested in lingering over battered and bloodied male faces.,1237
Twisted,"Overcooked dialogue, some wildly implausible story devices, and a dearth of remotely likable characters, and Twisted is a crime story that just doesn't pay.",1237
Twisted,Twisted is so bad I'm embarrassed to have seen it and therefore am a bit ashamed to write even an unkind review.,1237
Twisted,Sarah Thorpe's screenplay is a compendium of by-the-book clichés; Kaufman's direction leaves the material stranded in a limbo between po-faced and trashy; Judd's approximation of drunkenness is worrying to behold.,1237
Twisted,"Just like nearly all of Judd's past entries in the genre, this film isn't great, it's just average.",1237
Full Speed,"Fond is coarse and clumsy, devoid of wit and without emotion. [Full review in Spanish]",1238

Cutthroat Island,"...a larger-than-life (yet comfortably familiar) premise that is, at the outset, employed to engaging, briskly-paced effect...",1239
Cutthroat Island,"... A fitfully enjoyable, if frustratingly uneven and deeply flawed, attempt to create an unpretentious, thrills-and-spill adventure in the classic tradition.",1239
Cutthroat Island,"as a Saturday night frolic in ye olden style, Cutthroat Island is worth a visit",1239
Cutthroat Island,"A chaotic jumble of bad action, juvenile comedy and chilly romance, all wrapped in a cheesecloth of limp, lifeless pirate cliches.",1239
Cutthroat Island,"It's hardly the landlubber suggested by its reputation (which has more likely shifted more toward novel curiosity than cautionary tale). But if all the parties involved suspected they were going broke, they should have gone *for* broke to boot.",1239
Cutthroat Island,"Poorly written, acted, and executed advanture tale of pirates.",1239
Cutthroat Island,Geena Davis brings girl power to the pirate ship.,1239
Cutthroat Island,"Hey, are you looking for an exciting movie about pirates of the, well, um, Caribbean? [Blu-ray]",1239

Cutthroat Island,"What seemed like a dubious proposition on paper plays even more dubiously onscreen, as ""Cutthroat Island"" strenuously but vainly attempts to revive the thrills of old-fashioned pirate pictures.",1239
Ghost in the Shell,"Unlike in the anime, this version of the Major is more of a renegade than a leader and cares far more about herself than her teammates. She spends a large chunk of the movie pitying herself.",1240
Ghost in the Shell,"Overall, Ghost in the Shell pales in comparison to the 1995 film by lacking a cohesive, well developed plot, substantive themes and a captivating pace.",1240
Ghost in the Shell,"The presentation has been shaped to Hollywood specifications and robbed of its potential uniqueness, insight, or innovation.",1240

Ghost in the Shell,Fails to do anything beyond what's already on the page.,1240
Ghost in the Shell,"Filtered through a Hollywood lens, what was once a seminal work of cyber punk is reduced to a superhero origin story with action scenes aplenty.",1240
Ghost in the Shell,"To its credit, the sets are stunning, the costumes are faithfully adapted, and the makeup is flawless.",1240
Ghost in the Shell,"While it's fun to look at, it takes a good hour before we can get any sort of emotional content or drive for Major.",1240
Ghost in the Shell,"Of course Ghost in the Shell delights on a visual level, however without the complex foundation that made it popular and critically acclaimed in the first place, the end result is a massive disappointment.",1240
"Van, The",How this film received an R rating is beyond me. The gross factor alone is enough to warrant a new categorization by the MPAA.,1241
"Van, The","All things considered, National Lampoon's Van Wilder just doesn't fit the National Lampoon brand.",1241
"Van, The","The grossest, most disgusting humor imaginable.",1241
"Van, The","Rude, crude, obnoxious, disgusting, and unfunny...",1241
"Van, The",Strangely likable and only about half as puerile as the average MTV reality series.,1241
"Van, The","I know it's harder to write good jokes than it is rotten ones, but based on what's displayed here, it doesn't seem like the effort was even made.",1241
"Van, The","There's one saving grace: Reynolds may look a lot like NL's Chevy Chase, but, hey, he's actually quite likeable.",1241
"Van, The",...I will admit to having chuckled at an Erik Estrada cameo...,1241
"Van, The",Compare it to the recent Cameron Diaz-starring disaster The Sweetest Thing and you'll reckon it deserves an Oscar.,1241
"Van, The","...Mainly a collection of dumb sight gags, gross-out jokes, and comic sex, with a dull-as-dishwater premise and a spotty cast list.",1241
Night Flier,Creepy vampire tale that also offers some clever commentary on bloodthirsty tabloid journalists.,1243
Night Flier,A thuddingly blunt contemporary morality tale devoid of wit and only minimally suspenseful.,1243
Metro,"The blandness of the spouses remain but with little dimension, while the leads’ likeability is so doe-eyed and soft-edged as to require regular injections of rote narrative contrivance in place of genuine emotional conflict.",1244
Metro,"Despite teetering towards the edge of becoming overlong, the diaphanous poeticism that permeates every scene, thought, and word, is enough to keep things interesting. In a word: soothing.",1244
Metro,What enriches this film’s frothy concoction is its strong intellectual underpinnings. The questions raised about how social media has increased public persona versus private interactions carry a lot of weight.,1244
Metro,A valiant effort at showing how a simple act of kindness has the power to change someone's life.,1244
Metro,"While 8 A.M. Metro may not be the best film you'll see in 2023, it's a beautiful film that left me contemplating its messages and meditating upon its wisdom.",1244
Metro,"Gulzar’s poetry, which in most minds is an ideal, almost a benchmark, beyond criticism — often beyond clarity — here, comes like suffocating arabesques, pretty sounds, empty words, tired circumstances.",1244
Metro,The slow-burning drama has moments of acuity...,1244
Metro,"8 AM Metro is a languid tale but nowhere dull. If you sit rapt with attention, you will learn something about the meaning of love, life, loss and eventual healing. This is definitely worth a watch.",1244
Metro,"The director should have kept a faster pace and trimmed it to two hours or so. At 162 minutes, it feels a bit long. It’s buoyed by sterling performances by both Saiyami Kher and Gulshan Devaiah and the lyrical appeal of the narrative.",1244
Gridlock'd,Gridlock'd is a major social comedy waiting to happen.,1245
Gridlock'd,"Hall shows taste and humor as a filmmaker, and he is fortunate to have three leads who bring quirkiness and style to his film.",1245
Gridlock'd,"An engaging look at a mangy day in the lives of two junkies trying to kick, Gridlock'd would have been a good mid-level B.O. performer even without the interest surrounding it, due to the recent death of co-star Tupac Shakur.",1245
Gridlock'd,"A dark, effective satire about drug addiction that offers laughs as well as savage criticism of the US approach to dealing with users.",1245
Gridlock'd,"While not entirely successful, there's enough humor and humanism amid gritty urban locations to recommend Gridlock'd.",1245
Gridlock'd,"The ﬁlm has a fairly uninteresting narrative motor in its thriller subplot, but hits on an edgy black comic tone for Stretch and Spoon's increasingly pained dealings with the unsympathetic representatives of authority.",1245
Gridlock'd,"The late Shakur is especially impressive as the brighter of the duo -- a frazzled but infinitely patient character with a touching faith that somehow, if the pair just keeps plugging away, everything will turn out okay.",1245
Gridlock'd,"An ambitious, too ambitious, effort by Curtis Hall that shows talent and a future behind the camera.",1245
Gridlock'd,A very underrated film that is also very truthful,1245
Gridlock'd,"Written and directed by actor Vondie Curtis Hall, the film blends savvy and sour-mash humor with bone-deep sadness that recalls predecessors as varied as After Hours and Trainspotting.",1245
Celtic Pride,...a high-concept premise that’s employed to perpetually affable (if somewhat forgettable) effect...,1291

Celtic Pride,An uneven but largely likable basketball-themed comedy.,1291
Celtic Pride,"Celtic Pride supplies predictably lowbrow yocks for jocks, and its rather disturbing racial implications go entirely unacknowledged.",1291
Celtic Pride,The outcome is deeply unsatisfying.,1291
Celtic Pride,"A desperately unfunny comedy, and what's worse is that the premise really COULD have been something solid!",1291
Celtic Pride,Dismal attempt at basketball comedy,1291
Celtic Pride,"Kind of funny, especially for Celtic fans.",1291
Celtic Pride,This is one film that won't appeal to either sports or comedy fans.,1291
Celtic Pride,"This is a bad time for NBA fans in Boston. Just as their beloved Celtics are about to wrap up a dismal season, with nearly 50 losses and no berth in the playoffs, Hollywood comes out with a comedy about the Celtics that's even worse than the team.",1291
Boys in Venice,"This film’s perfectly good, but let’s hope the next one is great.",1359
Boys in Venice,"[W]hen Branagh plays up the despair lurking inside Poirot, A Haunting in Venice illustrates the battle between doubt and faith",1359
Boys in Venice,... you’ll probably solve the mystery faster than Poirot.,1359
Boys in Venice,"A captivating whodunit boosted by an evocative setting and stellar cast performances, it is a cinematic experience that not only keeps viewers guessing until the very end, but also leaves us haunted by its themes long after the credits roll.",1359
Boys in Venice,"It's just as well Branagh changed the title, because — location switch aside — there's almost nothing here that recalls the original story aside from Poirot, some of the other characters' names, and the presence of an apple bobbing tub.",1359
Boys in Venice,I love all three of Branagh's Poirot films for this thread of a broken man exploited and celebrated but desperate for a human connection to ground him in the world of the living...,1359
Boys in Venice,"Enjoyably melodramatic and nicely unnerving, though the tendency to shoot from above and at odd angles becomes headache-inducing, especially when one is trying to work out whodunnit (or indeed woohoodunnit). Camille Cottin and Emma Laird are stand-outs.",1359
Boys in Venice,"A likable, ""good enough"" mix of mystery and supernatural thriller.",1359
Boys in Venice,"For his second act - the best and most colorful - Branagh manages to sustain his film with tricks of the horror genre as old as they are elementary. But in this nightmarish Venice, they are beautiful and elegant. [Full Review in Spanish]",1359
Boys in Venice,"Reynolds leads Poirot to a Halloween party in a decaying and haunted palazzo, which provides the perfect backdrop for a spooky, jump-filled series of incidents.",1359
Withnail and I,"As the years pass, it's Robinson's mastery of tone that makes Withnail endure, that rich, sweet sadness that permeates every frame.",1404
Withnail and I,"The entertainment value is reserved almost exclusively for viewers familiar with, and amused by, England in the late ’60s, as well as those who could see it contemporarily, where its unorthodox structuring was most original.",1404
Withnail and I,"Withnail and I is a 5 star film for me, what is it missing? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Unintentionally it’s teaching its audience so much about life, friendship, and the British, and gives a lesson in acting and writing.",1404
Withnail and I,Withnail and I is more than passably diverting and surely preferable to mindless Hollywood summer movies. But it left me hungry to know much more about its characters and their era than the writer-director seems interested in providing.,1404
Withnail and I,"A brilliantly funny, enduring classic with an unforgettable performance from Richard E Grant.",1404
Withnail and I,British cult classic about two alcoholics; much profanity.,1404
Withnail and I,"If you are in the right mood, it is simply impossible not to fall for this hilarious tale of two hard-living losers.",1404

Withnail and I,"Every line is sharp, and the whole film finely judged and well paced.",1404
Withnail and I,"A career high for all concerned, including '80s British cinema.",1404
"Swan Princess, The",Charm replaced with cartoon violence in lackluster sequel.,1409
"Butcher Boy, The","The Butcher Boy is bold and often shocking, but the film’s playful humor crashes against the dark, manic, sometimes depressing material and makes for an oddly enjoyable-if-devastating drama.",1645
"Butcher Boy, The","The Butcher Boy is a trip, all right, but one that I'm sorry I took.",1645
"Butcher Boy, The","The movie is well-crafted and tightly assembled, but it's also loud and unmodulated.",1645
"Butcher Boy, The","...clumsily lurches from one irrelevant, uninteresting episode to the next...",1645
"Butcher Boy, The","Owens' remarkable, high-pitched performance and Jordan's lush, visionary style are perfectly suited to the material.",1645
"Butcher Boy, The","Intensely colourful, but somehow soulless.",1645
"Butcher Boy, The","Director Neil Jordan and Patrick McCabe adapted McCabe's novel for this bland 1998 shocker that fails miserably as satire, character study, and anything else it might have aspired to.",1645
"Butcher Boy, The",A horrific tale of madness and abuse told with pop-eyed color and giddy humor.,1645
"Butcher Boy, The","Though the movie sometimes looks as if the authentic Irish wit, colour and blarney has been filtered through the sensibility of a Buuel or Polanski, Jordan never allows the surreal/expressionist aspects to dominate.",1645
"Butcher Boy, The",The film almost immediately loses the major asset of the novel: its language. Possibly a quarter of the movie is incomprehensible to the American ear.,1645
Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story,"Focuses on her early years as a Bohemian journalist, a suffragette and an unwed mother.",1653
Chairman of the Board,"Carrot Top doesn't stretch from his prop-heavy stage act. He mugs, pouts and speaks loudly. Luckily for him, Jack Plotnick's annoying portrayal of Zak saves him from being the movie's worst actor.",1654
Target,"Target might be a lightweight assignment, but Penn works through its dramatic dilemmas with a proper moral seriousness.",1657
Target,"Gene Hackman’s first two collaborations with director Arthur Penn were 1967’s Bonnie and Clyde and 1975’s Night Moves -- it goes without saying that Target, their third and final teaming, proves to easily be the least of three.",1657
Target,Surprisingly misses the target.,1657
Target,"The basic concept is excellent and could have resulted in a nice, attractive movie with considerable style. But I'm afraid ""Hollywood"" got to it and as action came in the door, credibility leaped out a rear window.",1657
Target,Mr. Hackman seems to have been born for this role... Mr. Dillon seems to be putting the obnoxious punks of his early roles behind him for a somewhat more complex and satisfying characterization.,1657
Target,"Standard as it is, Target still manages to be entertaining and fun, and it contains a fine performance by Gene Hackman, a guy who always manages to keep his cool no matter what he's cast in or as.",1657
Target,Where oh where was the script doctor? It's basically a straight-line thriller with a few quasi-artistic curlicues.,1657
Target,"On one level, it's a well-told spy thriller. On another, it's an affecting, often humorous look at a father-son relationship. On any level, it's a sturdy vehicle for the talents of Gene Hackman and Matt Dillon...",1657
Target,An engrossing new thriller starring Gene Hackman and Matt Dillon.,1657
Target,"Target is definitely an action picture, but if s not one of those noisy thrillers that sets a quick pace and harsh tone and never lets up.",1657
"Substance of Fire, The","The actors are all fantastic in their roles, especially [Ron] Rifkin.",1658
"Substance of Fire, The",Suggests that there is no family wound that cannot be healed by love and forgiveness.,1658
"Substance of Fire, The","Because its ideas remain murky, it frustrates our expectations. It's not a satisfying film, but that doesn't make it a bad one.",1658

"New Age, The","There is brilliance all through The New Age -- in the writing and especially the performances of Peter Weller and Judy Davis, two of the best and most perennially underrated around. But it's a brilliance too pitiless and clear-eyed to be lovable.",1661
"New Age, The","The realities of their performances prove insufficient to pull Tolkin's bitter and deliberate tale from its doldrums, however, and this film lives u p to its title. Most of the time, it proves as repetitive and empty as an endless New Wave rhapsody.",1661
"New Age, The",A sometimes smart social commentary on Los Angeles characters who seek spiritual salvation when they can't buy every object they want.,1661
"New Age, The","Sporadically witty but not too deep, New Age, Tolkin's second feature as a director continues to explore satirically the lives of self-abosrbed yuppies on the verge of economic and moral collpase.",1661
"New Age, The",Presents a scathing critique of the emptiness in the lives of a couple addicted to materialism.,1661
"New Age, The",I spent the entire movie alternating between checking my watch to see how much was left and wishing that one of them would realize how worthless they were.,1661
"New Age, The",Tolkin gives us one richly detailed set piece after another.,1661
Rough Magic,"[It] aspires to be It Happened One Night-meets- Carlos Castaneda. Thanks to the stylish writing and direction, exotic locations, gorgeous visuals, the spirited work of Bridget Fonda as a gifted magician, and Russell Crowe as her romantic foil, it is.",1662
Rough Magic,Wild and zany film that mixes comedy with the magic realism of Latin American novels.,1662
Rough Magic,"Maybe the project was so weird it was doomed from the start. Give Rough Magic credit, however, for possessing all the pieces necessary to make two other movies that both might have worked.",1662
Rough Magic,Rough going.,1662
Nothing Personal,"The best romances instill in the audience the warm and fuzzy feeling that true love will conquer all, and everything will be right with the world. In present times when we need it the most, Just Sex, Nothing Personal gifts us that glorious feeling...",1663

8 Heads in a Duffel Bag,A mixture of screeching farce and grinding puns.,1664
8 Heads in a Duffel Bag,"Joe Pesci plays the mild-manner sadist on his trail, and judging by the credits, seems to have assembled his little on-set gang of mafiosi... Audiences will feel a lot less pampered.",1664
8 Heads in a Duffel Bag,"Pesci's breathless psycho routine can be wearing, but the script offers the odd sparkling lines.",1664
8 Heads in a Duffel Bag,It's about as funny as being a guest at the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.,1664
8 Heads in a Duffel Bag,The only surprise in this predictable movie is that it's by the man who won an Oscar for scripting Dead Poets' Society.,1664
8 Heads in a Duffel Bag,"With Joe Pesci squawking and Tom Schulman directing, it is nowhere near as funny as it should be.",1664
8 Heads in a Duffel Bag,"Films of this ilk were either funnier, or more horrific, in the 60s and the 70s.",1664
8 Heads in a Duffel Bag,"Its cartoon treatment of Mexicans smacks of racism, Comeau's a waste of space, and the farce is the dictionary definition of unfunny.",1664

Wedding Bell Blues,"Vividly conveys the mixed feelings many thirty-year- old women have about love, marriage and self-esteem.",1668
MURDER and murder,"MURDER and murder is a challenging watch, demanding rigorous attention and intellectual engagement... It has a wealth of information, a heaping dose of imagination, and a whole lot of heart to offer in return.",1669
Tainted,Neither nasty enough to qualify as a proper crime thriller nor sufficiently involving to be a genuine story of retribution. ...The grit is so thick you might as well be cleaning gravel out of your eyes after watching.,1670
Tainted,"What you do get is a bleak and brutal morality tale, one that carries the heavy message that you can never really walk away from all this violence.",1670

Kika,Kika demonstrates great security within Almodovar's style...pure fun. [Full review in Spanish],1672
Kika,"Kika is not good for several reasons. For one, Almodovar tries to get too serious.",1672
Kika,"While the film could potentially border on perverse, Almodóvar walks a tight rope making sure that the bawdy comedy is consciously never vile.",1672
Kika,"Using his typical assortment of aggressive female characters, Almodovar spends more time on the fashions of his protagonists than on their souls.",1672
Kika,"Kika is actually one of this film maker's more buoyant recent efforts, a sly, rambunctious satire that moves along merrily until it collapses -- as many Almodovar films finally do -- under the weight of its own clutter.",1672
Kika,Kika is a kinky post-modern pastiche fatally short on substance and energy.,1672
Kika,Painfully flat.,1672
Kika,"Almodovar's latest movie, Kika, is...an outrageous campy comedy about the omnipresence of tabloid TV.",1672
Kika,"A riot of colors, Kika is sometimes sick, sometimes playful, but consistently hilarious and entertaining in ways that few films have been lately.",1672
Kika,"Almodovar's central parody is strong enough to save this film from floundering too much or too often. It's daring and nasty, but rarely brilliant.",1672

Mirage,"A highly emotional drama, and Ugarte's performance more than delivers.",1673

Mirage,"[Director] Oriol Paulo succeeds in the emotional aspect, but slips in the thriller. [Full review in Spanish]",1673
Mirage,"Beyond the exquisite labyrinth of lost looks, we can always be attentive Adriana Ugarte's work, who is always at the edge. [Full Review in Spanish]",1673

Mamma Roma,Pasolini suggests in Mamma Roma that the spiritual beauty of humanity often emerges from vulgarity and contradiction.,1674
Mamma Roma,"Pasolini frequently uses those who push themselves to the margins of society to expose our collective and individual weaknesses, and our determination to maintain the image of order.",1674

Mat' i syn,"By the end of ""Mother and Son,"" I felt as lethargic as the half-dead mother in the title. Laboriously slow, the 73-minute movie drags on at a snail's pace, depicting the almost Oedipal relationship between a dying mother and her caretaker son.",1678
